    "summary": "The research investigates how team members' actual expertise and social status influence their perceived expertise and, consequently, their influence on team processes. It explores the conditions under which teams rely on perceived expertise versus social status to determine influence relationships, particularly in the context of different types of intragroup conflicts. The study finds that both actual expertise and social status have direct and indirect effects on member influence through perceived expertise. Additionally, it reveals that perceived expertise is initially driven by social status but later by actual expertise. The influence of perceived experts is also found to be higher when task conflict is high or relationship conflict is low. The implications of these findings for both research and practice are discussed.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main ideas of the research by focusing on the effects of actual expertise and social status on perceived expertise and influence within teams. It also highlights the conditions under which these factors are more or less salient, particularly in relation to intragroup conflicts. The findings regarding the temporal shift in what drives perceived expertise and the conditions that enhance the influence of perceived experts are also included, providing a comprehensive overview of the study's contributions.",
    "feedback": "The previous assistant's analysis was thorough and accurate, providing clear meanings and reasoning for each sentence. However, it would be helpful if the assistant could also highlight any potential limitations or gaps in the abstract that might affect the overall understanding of the research. Additionally, mentioning any key terms or concepts that are central to the study but not explicitly defined in the abstract could improve the analysis."
