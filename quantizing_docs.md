# Experimenting with Quantized Document Embeddings

In this section, we will explore the idea of **quantizing document embeddings** and conducting experiments to determine whether quantization provides **better classification results** compared to using non-quantized embeddings. The goal of this experiment is to see if quantization helps eliminate less relevant content while maintaining the core message of the research paper, which could improve classification outcomes, particularly at higher levels in the category hierarchy.

### Purpose of Quantizing Document Embeddings

The motivation for quantizing document embeddings is based on the idea that quantization can act as a **content simplification** mechanism. By reducing the precision of the embeddings, we might eliminate certain peripheral or overly specific information, allowing the classification system to focus on the **core themes and message** of the paper. This could be particularly effective for high-level classifications, where the overall topic of the paper is more important than its detailed methodology.

### Experimental Design

1. **Quantized vs. Non-Quantized Embeddings**: 
   - The experiment will involve comparing two versions of the classification systemâ€”one using **quantized embeddings** for documents and another using **non-quantized embeddings**. This will allow us to see if the reduced precision and simplified content from quantization improve or degrade classification accuracy.

2. **Steps for Experiment**:
   - **Generate Document Embeddings**: Create embeddings for research papers using Google Gemini Pro 1.5 (for extracting entities and key passages) and then convert these embeddings into quantized formats (e.g., 8-bit or 16-bit).
   - **Quantized Classification Process**: Run the classification system using quantized embeddings, focusing on the **Area of Study, Broad, Major, and Detailed categories**.
   - **Non-Quantized Classification Process**: In parallel, run the same classification pipeline using **non-quantized embeddings** for comparison.
   - **Measure Accuracy**: Evaluate the classification accuracy at each level (Area, Broad, Major, Detailed) for both quantized and non-quantized embeddings.
   - **Compare Performance**: Analyze the differences in accuracy and computational efficiency between the two approaches. Look for cases where quantization simplifies the content without sacrificing classification quality, and where it introduces errors due to loss of critical information.

### Hypotheses

- **High-Level Classification**: We expect quantized embeddings to perform well for **high-level classifications** (Area of Study, Broad categories), as these categories require capturing the general topic of the paper rather than fine-grained details.
- **Detailed Classification**: For **Major and Detailed categories**, there is a risk that quantization could degrade accuracy due to the loss of precision. Detailed classifications often rely on specific methodologies or technical terms, which could be lost during quantization.

### Benefits of Quantization

1. **Efficiency Gains**:
   - Quantization reduces the size of the embeddings, leading to **faster computations** when comparing embeddings during classification. This could be particularly beneficial when scaling the system to classify large datasets of research papers.

2. **Simplified Content Representation**:
   - By removing less relevant information, quantization might allow the system to focus more on the **core message** of the paper, improving classification accuracy at higher levels of the category hierarchy.

### Potential Drawbacks

1. **Loss of Precision**:
   - Quantized embeddings may lose important details that are necessary for **fine-grained classification**. For example, a slight nuance in methodology or terminology could be overlooked, leading to misclassification at the Detailed level.

2. **Generalization Issues**:
   - While quantization simplifies content, it may also make the embeddings more **generalized**, which could result in less accurate classifications for interdisciplinary papers that require capturing detailed relationships between different research fields.

### Metrics for Evaluation

- **Classification Accuracy**: Measure the classification accuracy at each level (Area, Broad, Major, Detailed) to determine whether quantization improves or degrades performance.
- **Computational Efficiency**: Compare the time and computational resources needed to classify papers using quantized vs. non-quantized embeddings.
- **Quality of Category Fit**: Analyze how well the quantized embeddings align with the intended categories, particularly at higher levels of the hierarchy (Area, Broad), and whether any drop in accuracy is observed at the more detailed levels.

### Next Steps

The results from this experiment will help determine if **quantizing document embeddings** provides any tangible benefits in terms of efficiency and accuracy. If quantization proves beneficial for high-level classifications, it could be selectively applied to certain layers of the classification pipeline, where general topic alignment is prioritized over detailed distinctions. For lower-level categories (Major, Detailed), non-quantized embeddings may still be necessary to maintain precision.
