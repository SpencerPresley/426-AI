    "summary": "This study explores how managers' perceptions of employees' organizational commitment influence their evaluations of employees' career growth opportunities. It reveals that managers interpret employees' attitudes and behaviors, such as strong performance and work engagement, as indicators of their commitment. Employees who are viewed as committed by their managers are likely to receive better career development opportunities. Furthermore, the study finds that the positive relationship between managers' perceptions of commitment and career growth is even stronger for employees who are also perceived as committed to their own careers.",
