    "summary": "This research investigates the influence of team members' actual expertise and social status on their perceived influence in team processes. It examines the conditions under which teams prioritize perceived expertise over social status in determining influence dynamics. The authors propose a contingency model that links the importance of expertise and social status to the types of conflicts that arise within teams. The findings reveal that both actual expertise and social status significantly impact member influence through perceived expertise, with social status being more influential in the early stages of team projects and actual expertise taking precedence later. Additionally, perceived experts are found to be more influential in situations of high task conflict or low relationship conflict. The study concludes by discussing the broader implications of these findings for both research and practical applications in team dynamics.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core investigation of the research, which is the interplay between actual expertise, social status, and perceived expertise in influencing team dynamics. It emphasizes the development of a contingency model and the empirical findings regarding influence in various conflict situations. The reasoning is grounded in the main themes presented in the abstract, reflecting the study's objectives, methods, findings, and implications without focusing on the specific methodologies used.",
