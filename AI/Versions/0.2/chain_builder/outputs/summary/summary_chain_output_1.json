    "summary": "This research paper examines the impact of deregulating foreign equity ownership on innovation investment in Korean manufacturing firms during the period from 1998 to 2003. The study utilizes data from 530 firms and finds that the relationship between foreign ownership and research and development (R&D) investment follows an inverted U-shape. Initially, increased foreign ownership enhances R&D investment due to improved managerial oversight, but this effect diminishes as foreign ownership becomes more concentrated. Additionally, the research highlights the role of firm characteristics, noting that older firms negatively moderate this relationship, whereas firms with greater growth opportunities positively influence it. Overall, the findings provide insights into how foreign ownership dynamics can affect a firm's innovation strategies.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main objective of the research, which is to explore the relationship between foreign equity ownership and innovation investment. It succinctly conveys the key findings regarding the inverted U-shaped relationship and the moderating effects of firm age and growth opportunities. The reasoning is based on a comprehensive understanding of the abstract, ensuring that the focus remains on the primary insights rather than the specific methodologies employed.",
