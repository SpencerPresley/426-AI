    "detailed_summary": "The paper examines the interplay between actual expertise, social status, and perceived expertise in determining influence within team processes. By leveraging expectation states theory and expertise utilization literature, the authors explore when teams prioritize perceived expertise over social status. They propose a contingency model that links the salience of these factors to types of intragroup conflicts. Utilizing multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams in South Korea, the study reveals that actual expertise and social status both directly and indirectly affect member influence through perceived expertise. Notably, perceived expertise is influenced by social status in the early stages of projects, while actual expertise takes precedence later on. Additionally, perceived experts are more influential in high task conflict situations or low relationship conflict scenarios. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of their findings for further research and practical applications in team settings."
