    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates how firms strategically combine alliances and acquisitions within the framework of exploration and exploitation. By employing cluster analysis on a substantial dataset of 1270 acquisitions from 836 firms, the researchers identified five distinct patterns of alliance and acquisition activities. These patterns vary from low to high levels of alliances and acquisitions. The analysis further delves into how these modes interact within the identified patterns, revealing that patterns III and IV foster a synergistic relationship between exploration and exploitation, while the other patterns exhibit a weaker coupling, predominantly focusing on exploitation. This research contributes to understanding strategic decision-making in firms regarding their collaborative and acquisition strategies."
