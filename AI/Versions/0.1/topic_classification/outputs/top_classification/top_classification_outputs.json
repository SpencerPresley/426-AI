                "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in living organisms can generate oxidative stress, which contributes to cell damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Studying responses to oxidative stress in model organisms, like the nematode wormCaenorhabditis elegans, may provide insight into basic underlying cellular mechanisms shared with humans. MRCK-1 (myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42 binding kinase), a highly conserved intracellular kinase, is activated by the G-protein, Cdc42, which contains a redox sensitive motif. Previous studies have shown that MRCK-1 regulates cell polarity and cytoskeleton reorganization, particularly during cell division and in response to cellular damage. To determine if MRCK-1 plays a role in other cellular defense responses, we are testing if RNA interference (RNAi) ofmrck-1results in the production of more ROS under stressed conditions. The cell permeable fluorescent ROS indicator, carboxymethyl dichlorodihydrofluorescein derivative, CM-H2DCFDA, shows significantly increased fluorescence in hydrogen peroxide-treated worms when quantified using the SpectraMax microplate reader. Oxidative stress conditions were induced with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of CM-H2DCFDA, and fluorescence was measured over a period of 20 hours. Measuring the fluorescence of worms exposed to dsRNA from two independentmrck-1RNAi constructs,mrck-mandmrck-s, enables the quantification of ROS levels when MRCK-1 function is decreased. Exploring the levels of ROS in RNAi-treated. elegansmay give further insight into the cellular role of MRCK-1 both in worms and in humans.",

                "abstract": "Inspired by spontaneously fermented beers, such as Belgian Lambic beers, American breweries have moved beyond using exclusively domesticated strains of the beer-making yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to experimenting with a variety of different yeast species to produce unique flavors and aromas. The so-called \"funky,\" \"wild,\" and \"sour,\" beers are produced using uncommon microorganisms either during or after the primary ferment. The goal of our research is to isolate, identify, and characterize wild yeasts from the local environment and to make them available to both commercial and craft brewers for making novel beers. The use of locally-sourced yeasts could also be used by commercial brewers as a marketing angle, as is often done with local hops, grains, or water. As a source of wild yeasts, we obtained various wild and cultivated fruits growing in rural Maryland and a sample of Belgium-style ale being aged in used oak wine barrels at Evolution Craft Brewing Company (Salisbury, MD). Yeast colonies were isolated using yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) agar plates containing antibiotics and identified by colony morphology as well as PCR amplification and sequencing of the 5.8S rRNA genes. The identified yeasts belong toSaccharomyces,Pichia,Candida, Fusarium,Torulaspora,and, most interestingly,Brettanomycesgenera. TheBrettanomycesyeast, which was isolated from the wine barrel ale, is normally considered a wine spoilage yeast but increasingly is being employed to create \"funky\" and sour flavors in beer. The growth and fermentation abilities of eight different yeast isolates were analyzed for growth in different liquid medias (YPD, hopped barley-malt extract, and merlot grape juice) using 96-well plates and spectroscopy. Growth rates were calculated using a modified grofit package in RStudio. Ethanol production will be determined using a colorimetric assay. Thus far, the most compelling discovery is a wild strain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaethat grows comparable to a commercially-available brewing yeast and produces pleasant, fruity aromas when fermenting barley malt extract. The complete characterization of these wild yeasts will be reported in order to identify novel wild yeasts that can be domesticated for local craft brewers.",

            {
                "abstract": "Ubiquitination is an essential, dynamic post-translational modification that regulates a diverse set of cellular processes. Ligation of the small peptide ubiquitin (Ub) onto substrate proteins by E3 Ub ligases can change protein localization, activity or stability. The most common outcome for Ub-tagged proteins is degradation via the 26S proteasome. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) reverse the effects of ubiquitination by removing Ub from tagged substrates. In animals, Ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) 12 and USP46 are related DUBs that regulate key proteins in important growth and differentiation signaling pathways. USP12 and USP46 each form trimeric complexes with two WD-repeat (WDR) proteins, WDR20 and WDR48. The WDR proteins activate the enzymatic abilities of the DUBs while potentially serving as substrate receptors. Numerous animal and fungal DUBs are bound and activated by specific WDR proteins. InArabidopsis, Ub-specific proteases 3 (AtUBP3) and 4 (AtUBP4) are related DUBs that have significant sequence similarities to animal USP12/46. Genetic studies have shown AtUBP3/4 are essential for proper pollen development and transmission. It is not yet known if WDR proteins bind and activate DUBs in plants. We have identified At2g37160 as a likelyArabidopsisWDR20 homolog based on amino acid sequence homology and the number and organization of WD motifs. We have shown At2g37160 (AtWDR20) interacts with both AtUBP3 and AtUBP4 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Biochemical characterization using recombinant proteins shows AtWDR20 increases the DUB activity of AtUBP3 over nine-fold. A yeast two-hybrid screen of anArabidopsiscDNA library using AtWDR20 as bait revealed interactions between AtWDR20 and two different E3 Ub ligases: Myb-30 Interacting E3 Ub ligase (MIEL1) and CHY Zinc-finger and Ring Protein 1 (CHYR1). Interactions between a DUB-associated WDR protein and E3 Ub ligases is intriguing, and implies AtWDR20 may function on both sides of the Ub cycle or is itself a target of ubiquitination.In plantaandin vitroanalyses will further characterize the interactions between AtWDR20, AtUBP3, and these E3 ligases.",

Analysis of semistructured, in-depth interviews with CAM providers ( n = 17) reveals that the frame of breaking boundaries was comprised of three themes: finding one's own strength; I don't prescribe, so I'm exploring; and ground yourself, and have an escape route. The themes describe preventive care by identifying how CAM providers negotiate their relational positionality in connecting with clients, structural positionality within the field of health care, and philosophical positionality within the ontological understandings that guide how health is defined and conceptualized. The study contributes toward enhancing diverse understandings of constituting preventive care in practice and suggests pragmatic implications for addressing biomedical provider communication with their patients seeking CAM care alongside conventional treatments.",

The native earthwormEisenoides carolinensiswas the most common earthworm, followed by two invasive speciesDendrobaena octaedraandOctolasion tyrtaeum. The presence ofO. tyrtaeumwas associated with a narrower O-horizon (i.e., organic layer in the soil). Using structural equation modeling to explore direct and indirect pathways of these three most common earthworm species on salamanders, I foundO. tyrtaeumoccurrence was negatively correlated with nighttime salamander counts, a proxy for total salamander numbers, mediated by negative effects on O-horizon depth and microinvertebrate numbers. In the laboratory,O. tyrtaeumandD. octaedraconsumed more leaf litter per gram of earthworm per day than the nativeE. carolinensis. However, salamanders consumed earthworms and used burrows of all native and invasive species of earthworms similarly. The potential for negative indirect effects of the invasive earthwormO. tyrtaeumonP. cinereuswas demonstrated both in the field and laboratory, highlighting that seemingly small differences between native and invasive ecosystem engineers have the potential to significantly alter the effects of these closely related native and invasive organisms.",

Based on a paired sample of 161 legal secretaries and their managers, results indicated that managers used the attitudes and behaviors displayed by employees (strong extra-role performance and enhanced work engagement) as cues from which to base their perceptions of employees' affective commitment to the organization. In turn, employees perceived as highly committed to the organization experienced enhanced content and structural career growth opportunities. Moreover, the relation between managers' perceptions of employees' organizational commitment and content career growth opportunities was stronger for employees perceived as also highly committed to their careers than for employees perceived as less committed to their careers.",

The interplay between these themes made it necessary to consider both social sciences and business, as well as education, to capture the full scope of the research. A clearer delineation of how these themes interact could help in categorizing similar abstracts in the future.",

Examining the grammar of visuality in which typographic choice, toponymic-allusion, punctuational detail, as well as onomastics and embedded speech acts emerge ripe in literal and metaphoric meaning, the paper demonstrates how acts of intertextual chaining of political history and candidate biography re-affirm the need for interpretive frameworks which are dynamic - not static - and which are simultaneously incorporative of exophoric text-context accounts of witnessed signage. The in-built potential of campaign yard signage in triggering contagious and conspicuous acts of affective stance-taking particularly in neighborhoods of geospatial contiguity are examined both for how they fit into LL research, as well as for how they prod further innovation in its interdisciplinary-inspired and evolving frameworks of analysis.",
