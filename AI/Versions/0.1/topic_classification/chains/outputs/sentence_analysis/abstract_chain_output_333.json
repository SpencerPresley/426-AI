    "overall_theme": "The research investigates the motivations, strategies, and implications of nonstate armed groups, specifically focusing on the LTTE's quest for sole representation within the Tamil community.",
    "detailed_summary": "This paper explores the previously unexamined topic of nonstate rebels, particularly focusing on why groups like the LTTE seek to be recognized as sole representatives of their communities. It poses critical questions regarding their motivations, strategies employed, and whether such status offers real benefits or is merely symbolic. The LTTE serves as a case study, with the research grounded in both primary and secondary data. The analysis identifies three key strategies used by the LTTE to assert dominance: eliminating rival groups, incorporating some factions, and demonstrating military effectiveness. These strategies were instrumental in facilitating government negotiations and lifting bans on the group, allowing them to influence administrative frameworks. However, while these tactics yielded some success, they also contributed to the LTTE's eventual downfall in 2009, highlighting the complexities of their quest for representation."
