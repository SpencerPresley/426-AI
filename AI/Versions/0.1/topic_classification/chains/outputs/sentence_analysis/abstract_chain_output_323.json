    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates how male and female candidates for principal positions in Wisconsin use language to express their values in job applications. By analyzing application data from 2,061 candidates through an electronic linguistic analysis tool, the researchers employed a mixed-methods approach that combined quantitative and qualitative analyses. The findings indicate significant differences in language use: female candidates often elaborate on ideas and use comparison techniques, while male candidates tend to adopt a more formal tone and rely on passive voice. These results raise important questions about potential unconscious biases in the selection process, suggesting that language patterns associated with each gender may influence hiring decisions."
