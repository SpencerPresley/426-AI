    "detailed_summary": "This paper conducts a meta-analysis of 29 studies to evaluate how internationalization affects the performance of family firms, while also examining the influence of various moderators. The findings reveal a significant positive correlation between internationalization and firm performance, particularly pronounced in firms with lower family ownership. Methodological factors, such as the means of measuring performance and internationalization, were found to significantly impact results. Additionally, cultural factors like individualism and masculinity were identified as moderators that enhance the positive relationship between internationalization and performance. The authors discuss the implications of these results for both practice and theory, while also suggesting areas for future research."
