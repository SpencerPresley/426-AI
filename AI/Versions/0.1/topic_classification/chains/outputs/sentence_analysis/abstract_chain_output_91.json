    "detailed_summary": "This qualitative embedded case study investigates how students experience alienation and intimacy in writing for an English language arts class, using critical theories of labor and commodification as its framework. Through the analysis of fieldnotes from 30 observations, student writing products, and reflective interviews with focal students and their teacher, the study reveals significant insights into how intimacy can be woven into instructional practices. Two key practices that foster intimacy are identified: a collective process of knowledge building about writing and open-ended work time that allows for flexible rules and expectations. The findings indicate that literacy practices can lead to varying experiences of alienation or intimacy, influenced by the industrialization and commodification present in educational settings. Although the teacher attempts to reduce industrial influences, the reliance on grades and standardized assessments exacerbates feelings of alienation. Ultimately, the study exemplifies how local actors, such as the teacher and students, can challenge these industrial systems by engaging more intimately with texts and working on a smaller scale."
