    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the adherence of emergency department providers to established guidelines regarding the treatment of acute low back pain, specifically comparing the prescriptions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. The research was conducted through a retrospective chart review at a rural emergency department, examining data from 162 patients who met specific inclusion criteria related to age and recent onset of low back pain. The findings revealed that a higher percentage of patients received opioid prescriptions compared to NSAIDs, despite guidelines recommending the latter. Notably, work-related injuries were associated with lower opioid prescription rates, and patients with pain onset within three days were more likely to receive opioids. The study underscores the need for enhanced education for emergency department providers on appropriate treatment options for acute low back pain to align practice with evidence-based guidelines."
