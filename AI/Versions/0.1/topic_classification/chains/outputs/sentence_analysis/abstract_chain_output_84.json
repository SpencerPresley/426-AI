    "overall_theme": "The research examines the role of self-leadership and psychological capital in influencing health-protective behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the potential for interventions that leverage these cognitive resources.",
    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the impact of self-leadership and psychological capital (PsyCap) on health-protective behaviors in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. It employs multiple theoretical frameworks, including social cognitive theory, psychological resources theory, and the health belief model, to develop and test a serial mediation model. The findings reveal that PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the relationship between self-leadership and specific health-protective behaviors, such as hand washing, wearing face masks, and social distancing. The results underscore the importance of self-leadership and PsyCap as cognitive resources, suggesting that interventions aimed at enhancing these traits could be beneficial, particularly for at-risk populations, during current and future health crises."
