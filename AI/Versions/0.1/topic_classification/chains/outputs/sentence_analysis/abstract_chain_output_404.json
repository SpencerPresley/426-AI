    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses a quality improvement project focused on heart failure, which is noted as the leading cause of 30-day hospital readmissions. The project aimed to assess whether providing 60 minutes of standardized education and scripted follow-up calls by trained nurses could decrease these readmissions, thereby enhancing patient outcomes and self-management. The study highlights the importance of addressing heart failure to mitigate adverse health effects and associated costs."
