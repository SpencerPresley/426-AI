    "detailed_summary": "This research article highlights the critical yet underexplored relationship between ethics and diversity within the social work profession. It introduces 'intersectional ethics' as a new ethical deliberation heuristic aimed at addressing this gap. Grounded in the theory of intersectionality and anti-oppressive practices, intersectional ethics employs six heuristic questions to analyze various ethical dimensions, including positionality and moral theories. The questions are designed to be incremental and cumulative, fostering a deeper engagement with anti-oppressive ethics and promoting critical reflection. Additionally, the article offers specific recommendations for incorporating this heuristic into social work ethics education, suggesting modules to facilitate its integration into the curriculum."
