    "detailed_summary": "This study addresses the underappreciated role of female bird song, particularly in temperate species like eastern bluebirds. While it has been traditionally believed that only male birds use song for mate attraction and competition, it is recognized that females in tropical species also sing for similar purposes. However, research on female song in temperate species has been limited. The authors aim to enhance understanding of female song functions, which may shed light on the evolutionary pressures influencing female vocalizations. Through a modeling framework that incorporates known song functions from various species, the researchers tested the role of female song in eastern bluebirds, identifying five functional categories of female song. The results indicate that female song is primarily used for pair communication, specifically to strengthen long-term pair bonds, which is beneficial for reproductive success. The study establishes a clear connection between the function of female song and the evolutionary advantages of maintaining these bonds, thereby highlighting its importance in temperate species."
