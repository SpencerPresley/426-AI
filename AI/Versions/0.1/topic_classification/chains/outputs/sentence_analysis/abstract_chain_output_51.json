    "detailed_summary": "The study addresses the significant issue of habitat loss affecting amphibians, specifically focusing on the endangered Eastern Tiger Salamander. It outlines the species' biphasic lifestyle, breeding in ephemeral ponds and migrating to terrestrial environments post-metamorphosis. The research aims to fill the gap in understanding habitat characteristics that influence breeding pond use. Data was collected on salamander occupancy, abundance, and water quality during the 2018 and 2019 breeding seasons, utilizing GIS to analyze pond area and surrounding landscape features. Key findings indicate that deeper ponds with less forest cover and larger sizes correlate with higher occupancy and abundance of the salamanders, with water quality parameters such as pH and conductivity also playing a role. Interestingly, forest area and road density did not emerge as significant factors despite the high forest cover around the ponds studied. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights for the conservation management of this state-endangered species."
