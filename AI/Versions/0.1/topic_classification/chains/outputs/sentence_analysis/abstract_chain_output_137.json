    "detailed_summary": "This study examines how the COVID-19 pandemic has increased stress and anxiety among individuals, proposing that psychological capital (PsyCap)\u2014which includes hope, optimism, resilience, and self-efficacy\u2014can help mitigate perceived stress through its influence on coping styles. The authors hypothesize that a negative correlation exists between PsyCap and perceived stress, with adaptive and maladaptive coping styles acting as mediators. They also posit that the context of work (home vs. workplace) moderates these relationships. Data were collected through an online survey in early May 2020, and the hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling techniques. The findings reveal that maladaptive coping is a stronger mediator than adaptive coping in the relationship between PsyCap and perceived stress. The results support the hypothesized model and suggest that interventions aimed at enhancing PsyCap could effectively reduce maladaptive coping and stress. The study calls for further research to explore PsyCap's role in promoting positive health behaviors, marking a unique contribution to the literature on stress and coping during the pandemic."
