    "detailed_summary": "This research explores the significance of the zygomatic root in relation to dietary practices among primates. The zygomatic root is hypothesized to strengthen the face against feeding stresses, potentially indicating dietary specialization in fossil species. However, its variability in living primates and predictive value regarding diet remain unclear. The study tests the hypothesis that primates consuming mechanically challenging foods have more anteriorly positioned zygomatic roots. Data were collected from 33 haplorhine species, totaling 722 specimens, using defined anatomical landmarks. Statistical analyses showed significant differences in zygomatic root position between species with varying diets, supporting the idea that a tougher diet correlates with a more anterior root position. However, phylogeny did not significantly affect root position, indicating that other factors may also influence dietary capabilities. The findings suggest that while zygomatic root position can indicate dietary specialization, it is not exclusively necessary for consuming mechanically challenging foods, as other adaptations also play a role."
