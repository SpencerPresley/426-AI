It aims to evaluate whether implementing a standardized workflow, including assigning urgency levels to referrals and marking electronic medical records as complete, can enhance hospice admission rates. Utilizing Kurt Lewin's change theory and the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle, the researchers collected data before and after the intervention. The results indicated an 11.5% increase in admissions and a significant 55.3% rise in EMR chart deactivations post-intervention, demonstrating that the standardized workflow effectively facilitated transitions from palliative care to hospice services."
