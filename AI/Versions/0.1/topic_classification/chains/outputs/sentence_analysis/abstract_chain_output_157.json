    "detailed_summary": "This research paper examines the geographical aspect of regulatory burdens, specifically focusing on the beer supply chain in the United States. While the economic impact of regulations is well understood, the authors note a lack of studies addressing how these regulations differ across various regions. They highlight that U.S. regulations can vary significantly due to the overlapping authority of federal, state, and local governments. Utilizing a unique dataset, the study analyzes the state-by-state variation in regulatory rules for the beer supply chain in 2020. The findings indicate a wide range of regulations, with states facing between 1,177 and 25,399 formal restrictions, and an average of 10,212 restrictions per state. This underscores the complexity and variability of regulatory environments impacting the beer supply chain across the United States."
