    "detailed_summary": "This study analyzes the succession of soil microbial communities in newly built salt marshes created from fine-grained dredge material, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to understand the changes over time. The findings reveal that alpha diversity in subsurface soils initially starts low but reaches natural reference levels within three years, while surface soils maintain high diversity throughout. The succession rate is fastest in surface soils, taking about 24 years to achieve reference equivalency, while deeper soils take longer. Statistical analysis identified key microbial taxa that contribute to these changes. In the parent material, there is an increase in sulfate-reducers, methanogens, and fermenters, indicating a shift towards natural marsh conditions. Concurrently, surface soils show rising populations of methane and sulfide oxidizers. Notably, one marsh exhibited a unique microbial profile with a higher abundance of anaerobic taxa, linked to signs of excessive inundation stress. The study concludes that microbial community structures could serve as effective bioindicators for assessing salt marsh inundation, warranting further research into their ecological roles."
