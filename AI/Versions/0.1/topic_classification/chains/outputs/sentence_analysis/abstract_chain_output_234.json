Utilizing a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample of 478 adults, the research employs structural equation modeling to analyze the relationships between trust in information sources and behaviors related to COVID-19 prevention and social distancing. Key findings indicate that understanding COVID-19 is linked to trust in formal sources, while self-efficacy for prevention relates to trust in informal sources. Additionally, worry about contracting the virus is associated with trust in formal sources and influences engagement in preventive measures, while social distancing is primarily related to worry. The implications of these findings are significant for public health policy, underscoring the need for clear and truthful media messaging. Furthermore, the results facilitate comparative analyses of reactions to information sources across different cultures and pandemics, enhancing the understanding of public response to health information over time."
