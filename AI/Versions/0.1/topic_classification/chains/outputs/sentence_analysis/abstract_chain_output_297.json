By examining the experiences of participants who completed a structured training program for clinical faculty, the study highlights the importance of understanding the challenges and supports needed in nursing education. Focus groups were utilized to gather insights on how participants perceived their learning process. Through interpretive phenomenological analysis, three key themes emerged: uncertainty about their abilities, changes in perspective regarding teaching, and the importance of building confidence. The findings suggest that novice educators benefit significantly from diverse teaching methods, simulated teaching experiences, and collaborative debriefing sessions, which can inform improvements in nursing education programs."
