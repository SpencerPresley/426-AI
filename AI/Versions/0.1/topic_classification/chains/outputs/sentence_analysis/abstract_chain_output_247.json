    "detailed_summary": "The study examines the impact of contraction order on metabolic responses during resistance training, specifically comparing monophasic concentric and eccentric squat protocols against a mixed approach. Twelve recreationally active men participated in the study, performing three squat protocols that varied only in contraction type. The methods involved controlled lifting and lowering of weights, with oxygen consumption measured through indirect calorimetry. Results indicated that metabolic rates were significantly higher during concentric-eccentric squats compared to eccentric-concentric, while EPOC was greater following eccentric-concentric squats. Overall, the findings suggest that the type and order of muscle contractions play a crucial role in metabolic responses, with implications for resistance training strategies."
