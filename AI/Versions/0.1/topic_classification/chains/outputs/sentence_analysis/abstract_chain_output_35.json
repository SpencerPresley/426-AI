    "detailed_summary": "This research explores the habitat use of yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys in the Una Biological Reserve, focusing on how food availability and predation risks influence their behavior. The researchers hypothesized that high hunting pressure would lead these monkeys to prioritize avoiding predators over foraging for food. They characterized various factors affecting habitat use, including resource availability and both perceived and actual predation risks. The findings indicated that the monkeys' habitat use was significantly influenced by the risks posed by human hunting and other predators, while food availability, particularly fruit biomass, had little effect. Ultimately, the study confirmed that in high hunting pressure environments, the risks of predation have a more substantial impact on the monkeys' space use than the availability of food resources."
