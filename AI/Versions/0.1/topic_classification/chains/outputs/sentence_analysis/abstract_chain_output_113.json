    "detailed_summary": "This research paper explores the significance of tool use in the context of human evolution by examining its effects on the dietary habits of wild capuchin monkeys that use stone tools to crack palm nuts. The study employs multi-dimensional nutritional geometry to analyze the energy and macronutrients in the monkeys' diets. The findings indicate that tool use leads to more consistent dietary intakes, a 50% increase in net energy gain, and a 7% decrease in fiber consumption. While protein intake remained stable, the research suggests a pattern of macronutrient regulation akin to that observed in contemporary humans. Additionally, tool use contributed to a more balanced ratio of protein to non-protein energy. The implications of these findings suggest that early tool use may have enhanced the nutritional security of ancestral hominins, paving the way for cultural development."
