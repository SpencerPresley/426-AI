The authors conduct a literature review to formulate a hypothesis and test it using both primary and secondary data. The findings reveal that environmental uncertainty negatively affects financial performance, with entrepreneurial managerial capitalism playing a mediating role. Furthermore, the study emphasizes that organizations that implement macro and network supply chain risk management practices can enhance decision-making and reduce the adverse financial impacts of environmental uncertainty. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for managers and practitioners, highlighting the importance of effective risk management strategies in today's globalized supply chains."
