    "detailed_summary": "The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is a significant astronomical survey aimed at mapping the Milky Way's chemical and dynamical structures using near-infrared spectroscopy. The targeting strategy for the survey has undergone complexity and evolution, leading to updates and additions that are discussed in this paper. These updates include two main modes of implementation: the introduction of 'Ancillary Science Programs' awarded to researchers and a 1.5-year survey extension known as the Bright Time Extension (BTX), which arose from efficiency gains. The paper describes 23 distinct ancillary programs, detailing their scientific aims and target selection methods. The BTX has allowed for strategic changes, including the addition of new programs and the expansion of existing ones based on recent scientific discoveries and data availability. Furthermore, the authors reflect on nearly a decade of experience from both APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2, summarizing lessons learned. Additionally, the research mentions a companion paper that addresses targeting modifications for the Southern Hemisphere operations of APOGEE-2, indicating a broader scope of investigation."
