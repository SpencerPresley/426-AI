    "detailed_summary": "This research paper introduces a Bayesian framework aimed at estimating parameters in effective field theories, particularly focusing on nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials derived from chiral effective field theory (chi EFT). The authors present selected results showcasing the application of their framework to the semi-local NN potential of Epelbaum, Krebs, and Mei beta ner (EKM). They note the availability of extensive NN scattering data, which is precise and covers high energies, leading to minimal impact from penalties on low-energy constants unless limited data is used. The study emphasizes the significance of including higher-order terms in chi EFT for accurate parameter estimation. Through two case studies, the authors explore the implications of their Bayesian approach. The first study reveals the degeneracy of certain parameters in the fourth-order EKM potential, traced to a specific operator that vanishes on-shell. The second study assesses the stability of low-energy constants when incorporating more high-energy data, demonstrating that as long as truncation errors are managed, the extracted values are reliable regardless of the maximum energy considered. Finally, the paper compares models for truncation errors, suggesting the potential of Gaussian processes for improved correlation modeling."
