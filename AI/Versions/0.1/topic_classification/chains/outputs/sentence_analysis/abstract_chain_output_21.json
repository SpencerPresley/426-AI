    "detailed_summary": "This research paper examines how team members' actual expertise and social status impact their influence in team processes through perceived expertise, utilizing expectation states theory and expertise utilization literature. The study aims to identify the conditions under which teams prioritize perceived expertise over social status in influence dynamics, presenting a contingency model that links the salience of these factors to types of intragroup conflicts. The authors analyze multiwave survey data collected from 50 student project teams in South Korea, concluding that both actual expertise and social status significantly affect member influence. They find that social status drives perceived expertise at the early stages of projects, while actual expertise becomes more important later on. Additionally, perceived experts are shown to be more influential in high task conflict or low relationship conflict situations. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for future research and practical applications in team settings."
