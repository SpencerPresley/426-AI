    "detailed_summary": "This study addresses the complexities of assessing adolescent sexual identity, noting that existing measures fail to capture the diversity of contemporary identities. By analyzing a large national dataset of sexual minority adolescents aged 14-17 in the United States, the researchers aimed to propose a taxonomy of sexual identities. Participants answered both close-ended and open-ended questions regarding their sexual identity, which were coded through content analysis procedures to identify eight distinct categories of sexual identities. The study found significant differences in sexual identification based on close-ended responses, age, and assigned sex at birth, but no differences based on race or urbanicity. Furthermore, it revealed that adolescents identifying with less common sexual identities are at a higher risk for negative mental health outcomes. The findings underscore the need for updated measures and suggest that future research should utilize the proposed taxonomy to enhance data collection on adolescent sexual identities. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the importance of recognizing diverse sexual identities and their impact on mental health among adolescents."
