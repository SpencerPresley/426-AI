    "detailed_summary": "This research investigates how firms are evolving into agile enterprises through the integration of digital technologies. It builds on prior research that connects organizational mindfulness with effective management of digital technologies to mitigate rigidity. Notably, while the significance of organizational mindfulness is recognized, its specific impact on digital transformation and the development of information processing capacity (IPC) has not been thoroughly studied. The authors conceptualize IPC from the information processing view and analyze the relationships between organizational mindfulness, IPC, and market agility. Their empirical study, based on a survey of 102 managers from US companies, reveals that organizations that are mindful during their digital transformation are more adept at establishing a robust digital infrastructure, fostering both internal and external relationships enabled by technology, and aligning business strategies with digital initiatives. These capabilities significantly enhance their responsiveness to market changes."
