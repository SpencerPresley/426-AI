    "detailed_summary": "This study explores the food-burying and food-transport behaviors of the invasive red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta, which are commonly observed during foraging. While food-burying behavior is prevalent in many mammals and birds, it is rarely documented in invertebrates, making this research significant. The study aims to understand the factors affecting food-burying behavior and its measurable patterns, which are largely unknown. Observations were conducted in both laboratory and field conditions. In laboratory settings, when ants were starved for 37 days, they consumed food but exhibited minimal burying behavior. Conversely, when food was provided until the ants were satiated, food-transport behavior decreased, and more soil particles were relocated near the food. The study found that ants initially placed larger soil particles adjacent to the food and later covered it with smaller particles, with only a few small worker ants engaging in burying behavior. A total of 12 distinct patterns of particle transport were identified, primarily involving soil particles picked from the foraging arena. In field observations, all released food was actively transported by the ants, with no burying behavior noted. The results suggest that food-burying behavior in Solenopsis invicta is linked to reduced foraging activity and is performed by specific groups of workers."
