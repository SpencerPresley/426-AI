    "detailed_summary": "This study examines the early parenting experiences of 34 parents of pre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) youth, emphasizing the significant role that parental support plays in the psychosocial outcomes of these children. Despite the critical nature of this support, the abstract notes a lack of existing research on the parents' experiences. The methodology involved recruiting parents from online communities and conducting phone interviews, with the data analyzed through thematic analysis. Key findings reveal that parents typically became aware of their child's TGNC identity at around 3.5 years old, either through observation or direct communication. The emotional responses of parents varied, with many expressing a lack of concern regarding their child's deviation from traditional gender roles. Additionally, parents with little prior knowledge of transgender issues sought information online. The findings both align with and contrast previous research, suggesting new avenues for further investigation and highlighting ways to better support TGNC youth and their families."
