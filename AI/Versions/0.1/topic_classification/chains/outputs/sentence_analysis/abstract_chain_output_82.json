    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the threats posed by human activities, particularly agricultural expansion, to the bearded capuchin monkeys in northeastern Brazil. The research documents the tool-use behaviors of these monkeys, which vary by habitat, and emphasizes the role of social learning in acquiring these traditions. Over the past 30 years, significant land cover changes have been observed, with agriculture increasing by over 300%. Predictive modeling indicates that if trends continue, only a small fraction of forest will remain in certain areas, jeopardizing the capuchin population. The findings stress the urgency of limiting agricultural expansion and highlight the importance of incorporating behavioral traditions into conservation efforts, as these traits are not universally shared among the species."
