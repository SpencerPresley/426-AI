            "meaning": "The author uses data from Iranian Azerbaijani migrants to introduce the concept of 'chronotopization', which explains how social behavior norms are shaped by temporal, spatial, and interpersonal factors.",
            "reasoning": "The phrase 'drawing on data' indicates the use of empirical evidence, while 'chronotopization' suggests a theoretical framework that connects time and space to social behaviors.",

            "meaning": "The author claims that various levels of 'chronotopes of normalcy' influence how individuals behave linguistically and make judgments about what is considered normal.",
            "reasoning": "The terms 'differently scaled' and 'guide' imply that there are multiple layers of understanding normalcy that affect social interactions and language use.",

            "meaning": "The author analyzes what participants say about language choices to show that the concepts of time and space in understanding normalcy can enhance our understanding of language use in various contexts.",
            "reasoning": "The phrase 'metacommentaries on appropriate language choice' suggests a qualitative analysis, and 'broader theory of language use' indicates a theoretical contribution to sociolinguistics.",

    "overall_theme": "The abstract presents the concept of 'chronotopization' as a framework for understanding how social behavior norms, particularly in sociolinguistics, are influenced by temporal and spatial contexts as evidenced by Iranian Azerbaijani migrants.",
    "detailed_summary": "This research paper introduces the notion of 'chronotopization' based on data collected from Iranian Azerbaijani migrants. It aims to explore how perceptions of normative social behavior are formed and organized in relation to time, space, and interpersonal dynamics. The author argues that different scales of 'chronotopes of normalcy' play a crucial role in guiding individuals' sociolinguistic behaviors and their judgments regarding what is considered normal. By analyzing participants' discussions on language choice, the paper posits that these chronotopic and scalar understandings can expand the theoretical framework of language use, suggesting applicability to various sociolinguistic phenomena beyond just language choice."
