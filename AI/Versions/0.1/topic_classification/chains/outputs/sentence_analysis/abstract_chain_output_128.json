    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses the significant flooding and damage caused by Hurricane Isabel in 2003, particularly in Chesapeake Bay and surrounding areas. It describes the use of regional atmosphere-ocean models to predict the effects of future storms under climate change scenarios, focusing on warmer ocean temperatures and rising sea levels. The study finds that climate warming is likely to intensify storms, resulting in lower sea level pressures and higher peak water levels. It predicts that the inundated area in Chesapeake Bay will expand significantly by 2050 and 2100, with specific increases noted for rural Dorchester County and Baltimore. The number of houses at risk of flooding and the estimated flood damage in Baltimore are also projected to rise dramatically. The abstract concludes by noting that these estimates carry uncertainties due to varying climate models and scenarios."
