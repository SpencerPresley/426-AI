It begins by noting the increasing focus on CSR in enhancing stakeholder perception and brand image over the past decade. However, it identifies a gap in literature regarding CSR's role in reputation management specifically during supply chain disruptions. To address this, the authors conduct a literature review and formulate a hypothesis, which they test through quantitative analysis of primary and secondary data sourced from global organizations. The results indicate that CSR practices are vital for firms to mitigate the negative impacts of supply chain disruptions on their corporate reputation. Furthermore, the study concludes that CSR practices not only enhance supply chain risk management (SCRM) but are also essential for the effectiveness of these practices in improving organizational reputation."
