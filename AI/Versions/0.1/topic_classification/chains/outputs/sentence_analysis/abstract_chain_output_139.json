    "detailed_summary": "The HRBS-GLWNB 2020 initiative presents a pioneering open-source repository of high-resolution bathymetric, shoreline, and water level data for Lakes Victoria, Albert, Edward, and George in East Africa. This project generated three primary data products for each lake, derived from an extensive collection of approximately 18 million acoustic soundings to create bathymetric datasets. Additionally, over 8,200 kilometers of shorelines were mapped using advanced satellite systems and uncrewed aerial vehicles, ensuring detailed delineation. The integration of these datasets involved creating lake surface elevation models based on GPS and altimeter measurements. The repository also includes derived metrics such as surface areas, water volumes, and geodetic information. The practical applications of this data extend to making informed decisions regarding freshwater resource allocation, managing food resources critical for tens of millions, and preserving endemic biodiversity in the region. Furthermore, the data's alignment with globally consistent geodetic models positions it as a valuable resource for future climate change research at both global and regional levels."
