An event study in the cable television industry reveals that adding SBDTC channels complicates relationships and can lead to conflicts that diminish firm value. However, certain firm-specific characteristics and strategic execution can mitigate these negative impacts. Notably, firms with greater channel power are less affected by conflicts and can benefit from SBDTC channels. Additionally, firms that market high-quality, differentiated offerings enjoy more favorable valuations, suggesting that product quality and uniqueness play a crucial role in the context of SBDTC channels."
