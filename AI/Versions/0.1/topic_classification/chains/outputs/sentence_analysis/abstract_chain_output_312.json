    "detailed_summary": "The research highlights the significance of tracking non-native reptiles, specifically the mourning gecko (Lepidodactylus lugubris), to understand their ecological effects. The authors present new observations of this species on Paradise Island in The Bahamas, coinciding with citizen science contributions from the iNaturalist platform. Additionally, a second report from Grand Cayman is documented, indicating the species' spread since its first record in the Caribbean a decade ago. The findings underscore the utility of citizen science in monitoring non-native reptiles and note the gecko's ability to inhabit natural environments, which raises concerns about potential negative impacts on native species. Overall, the study illustrates the importance of continued observation and research on non-native species in the Caribbean."
