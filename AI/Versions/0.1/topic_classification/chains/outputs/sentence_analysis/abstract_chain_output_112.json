            "meaning": "Previous studies treat financial literacy as an external factor, but this paper introduces a model where financial literacy is influenced by the consumer\u2019s own investment efforts.",
            "reasoning": "The terms 'exogenously given' and 'endogenously determined' highlight a shift in perspective, suggesting that this paper aims to redefine how financial literacy is conceptualized.",

            "reasoning": "The term 'substitutes' implies that one action can replace or diminish the need for the other, which aligns with the previous sentence about the relationship between the two factors.",

            "reasoning": "The phrase 'cannot be easily explained' suggests that the findings are unexpected, and 'reconciles the results' indicates that the new model offers a solution to the discrepancies.",

    "detailed_summary": "This research paper examines the interplay between financial literacy investment and the decision to seek advice from financial planners. Unlike previous studies that consider financial literacy as a fixed trait, this paper introduces a model where it is shaped by consumer investment. The authors hypothesize that increased financial literacy can serve as a substitute for professional financial advice. To test this hypothesis, they utilize data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances and apply propensity score matching to mitigate self-selection bias. The findings reveal a significant negative correlation between financial literacy investment and the likelihood of consulting a financial planner. These results challenge existing models, but the authors argue that their approach of endogenizing financial literacy helps explain the observed relationship."
