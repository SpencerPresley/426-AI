    "overall_theme": "The research explores the complex relationship between donation communication in cause-related marketing and consumer perceptions, particularly focusing on skepticism and price fairness.",
    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses the importance of clear communication regarding donation amounts in cause-related marketing (CM) and its positive impact on campaign effectiveness. However, it highlights a disconnect, as many firms use ambiguous language when discussing their contributions. The authors conduct three studies to investigate when monetary quantifiers might be less effective due to consumer skepticism about firms' motives. Study 1 finds that CM promotions can enhance perceptions of price fairness. Study 2 reveals that different formats of donation quantifiers uniquely influence price fairness, mediated by skepticism. Finally, Study 3 presents strategies for practitioners to mitigate consumer skepticism, thereby improving perceptions of price fairness and increasing purchase intent. Overall, the research emphasizes the need for careful communication strategies in CM to foster trust and enhance consumer responses."
