    "detailed_summary": "This study explores the role of resilience, defined as the ability to recover from adversity, in the context of psychological distress, academic burnout, and student attrition among business students at four U.S. universities. A survey was distributed to a sample of 1,119 students, employing structural equation modeling to analyze the relationships between the variables. The results revealed that psychological distress is positively associated with academic burnout, which in turn correlates with increased intentions to leave school. While resilience did not moderate these relationships, it was found to lessen their impact by being inversely related to both psychological distress and certain aspects of academic burnout. The findings suggest that enhancing resilience could be a valuable strategy for educators to reduce student turnover and prepare students for workplace challenges."
