    "detailed_summary": "This exploratory study addresses a significant gap in research regarding the ability of older adults with Parkinson's disease to rise from the floor, despite considerable attention to fall prevention. It aims to explore the correlation between floor rise performance and various physical performance tests. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, the study involved twenty community-dwelling older adults with a mean age of 74.8 years. Participants completed a standardized floor rise test along with physical performance assessments. The results indicated that the average time to rise from the floor was 14.9 seconds, with 70% of participants using a quadruped strategy to stand. Additionally, performance times for rising from a supine position were significantly correlated with all measured physical performance metrics. The findings suggest important implications for nursing and rehabilitation professionals, advocating for a focus on assessing floor rise ability to mitigate the risks associated with falls and improve recovery techniques in clinical environments."
