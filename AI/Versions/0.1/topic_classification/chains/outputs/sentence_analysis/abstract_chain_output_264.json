    "overall_theme": "The research explores the relationship between education levels and natural disaster awareness, demonstrating that education plays a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of natural hazards.",
    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates how education influences awareness and mitigation of natural disasters by analyzing its relationship with the World Risk Index (WRI). The authors created an independent education factor based on PISA 2018 Science test results and examined its correlation with various components of the WRI across 15 countries that exhibit a wide range of natural hazards. The analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between the education factor and several WRI parameters, indicating that higher education levels are associated with lower vulnerability and better coping capacities. The findings also highlighted that countries with lower risk are often more aware of natural hazards, while those at higher risk tend to lack awareness. Ultimately, the research concludes that enhancing education can significantly improve awareness of natural hazards and reduce their overall impact."
