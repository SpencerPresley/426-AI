    "detailed_summary": "This study analyzes data from the APOGEE survey to explore how stellar rotation relates to the presence of multiple stars in a system. The authors create a dataset of 2786 giants and 24,496 dwarfs, examining various stellar parameters and radial velocities. They use the maximum shift in radial velocities as a proxy for the close binary fraction, linking it to stellar evolution and rotation. Theoretical calculations based on orbital dynamics yield predictions that match observed correlations between rotation speeds and radial velocity shifts. Notably, fast-rotating stars are found to have many short-period companions, and older rapidly rotating stars exhibit higher close binary fractions than younger ones. Additionally, discrepancies in predicted and measured ages for rapidly rotating stars suggest that current methods for estimating stellar ages may need reevaluation. Overall, the findings indicate a strong correlation between stellar rotation and multiplicity, highlighting the influence of tidal interactions and cautioning against the straightforward application of gyrochronology relations for cool stars."
