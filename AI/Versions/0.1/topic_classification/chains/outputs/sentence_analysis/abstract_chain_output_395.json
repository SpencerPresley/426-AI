The methodology combines personal narratives, critical analysis, and collective memory work, drawing on influential educational theorists. The authors respond to concerns about the lifelessness of the curriculum by advocating for teachers to actively cultivate memories, recommending strategies like collective memory work and reflective narratives to enhance their teaching practices."
