    "detailed_summary": "This research investigates the navigation strategies of wild elephants, proposing that they prefer habitual routes over Euclidean paths when revisiting resource sites. A Python script was developed to identify these habitual routes based on frequently used segments. Findings reveal that elephants demonstrate flexible navigation strategies in Kruger National Park, shifting their methods based on the familiarity of their surroundings. In well-known areas, they utilize Euclidean navigation, while in less familiar peripheral areas, they revert to habitual routes. These behaviors align with similar findings in smaller mammals, suggesting a broader principle of spatial navigation influenced by familiarity. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of intersections in habitual routes, indicating that these points play a critical role in decision-making during navigation, contributing to the elephants' cognitive mapping of their environment."
