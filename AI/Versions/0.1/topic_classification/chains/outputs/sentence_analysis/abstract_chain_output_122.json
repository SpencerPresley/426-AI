    "detailed_summary": "This study examines the effects of habitat loss and degradation on the endangered Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata), particularly focusing on its habitat preferences and resource competition with more common turtle species. The researchers collected habitat data, including water quality and vegetation measurements, to analyze how environmental factors correlate with the abundance of the Spotted Turtle. They found that its population is negatively influenced by low oxygen and pH levels in water, while positively correlated with deeper water bodies and more canopy cover. The investigation of niche overlap revealed that Mud Turtles and Painted Turtles negatively correlated with the Spotted Turtle's abundance, while Snapping Turtles did not, suggesting complex interspecific interactions. Structural equation modeling was employed to discern the nature of these relationships, and stable isotope analyses indicated that all turtle species shared similar, broad diets. The findings suggest that competition and dietary overlap could negatively impact the Spotted Turtle's abundance, emphasizing the need for conservation strategies that consider the coexistence of endangered and common species, especially as habitat loss constrains available habitats."
