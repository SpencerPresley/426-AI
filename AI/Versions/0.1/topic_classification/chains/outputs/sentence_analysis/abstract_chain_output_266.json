It examines the distinction anarchists made between nation/nationality and state/nationalism, arguing that they sought to be stateless but not nationless. The article posits that these anarchists expressed a robust, countercultural nationality characterized by militancy, opposition to state authority, and rejection of religious influence. Described as 'rooted cosmopolitans,' they maintained a connection to Germany's radical heritage while aligning with global revolutionary traditions. Their consistent critiques of various German political regimes, regardless of their location, and their advocacy for a borderless federation of free communities reflect their commitment to exposing the failures of statism and nationalism."
