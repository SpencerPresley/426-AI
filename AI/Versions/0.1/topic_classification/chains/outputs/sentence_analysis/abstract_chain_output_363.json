    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates how temporality is understood within Ayurvedic protocols for managing chronic pain. It identifies a significant gap in pain research regarding the temporal management of chronic pain despite its acknowledged importance. The research question focuses on the conceptualization of temporality in Ayurvedic practices, involving ten Ayurvedic physicians from India. A semi-structured interview approach was used to gather qualitative data, which was then transcribed and analyzed thematically. To ensure the reliability and validity of the findings, strategies such as member validation and researcher self-awareness were employed. The findings reveal that Ayurvedic protocols conceptualize temporality through spatiotemporal present moment awareness (PMA) and embodied time (ET). PMA relates to the cognitive understanding of time and its physical implications, while ET emphasizes the emotional and psychosocial dimensions of time as experienced through the body. The study concludes by proposing a framework that positions spatiotemporality as a key organizing principle in chronic pain management, differentiating it from the traditional understanding of temporality."
