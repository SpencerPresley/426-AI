    "detailed_summary": "The study addresses the reliance of Caribbean islands, particularly Puerto Rico, on rainfall due to limited groundwater and reservoirs. It emphasizes the necessity of predicting seasonal rainfall shortages, noting the lack of effective tools for this purpose. The methodology involves summarizing interpolated precipitation observations from the Daymet archive and comparing them to the Galvez-Davison index (GDI), which is tailored for tropical climates. Additionally, the research analyzes over 1.1 million radar volume scans to create a database of precipitation activity. The findings indicate that the GDI is superior to midlatitude indices, explaining about 25% of daily echo top activity in Puerto Rico's primary seasons. Other indices showed limited effectiveness. The GDI correlates strongly with precipitation data during the early rainfall season, which significantly influences annual rainfall variability, particularly in extreme weather conditions. The study's results have implications for climate modeling and operational forecasting, suggesting that the GDI could be adapted for future precipitation predictions in Puerto Rico."
