    "detailed_summary": "The research focuses on the aggregation behavior of Heortia vitessoides larvae, a pest that significantly impacts the production of economically valuable agarwood from Aquilaria sinensis. The study involved collecting a large number of larvae from the wild and categorizing them by developmental stages. Findings indicate that younger larvae tend to form larger groups, while older larvae are more solitary or in smaller groups. Laboratory experiments confirmed strong aggregation tendencies among newly hatched and second-instar larvae. Importantly, isolation was detrimental to the survival of newly hatched larvae. The study also explored the effects of mixing treated and untreated larvae, finding that treated larvae negatively impacted the survival and emergence of untreated ones, suggesting chemical transfer. Overall, the research enhances understanding of H. vitessoides ecology and offers insights for pest management strategies."
