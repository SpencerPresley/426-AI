    "detailed_summary": "The research paper investigates the intersection of Ayurveda and patient-centered care (PCC) in managing chronic pain, emphasizing how Ayurveda's preventive focus can complement biomedical interventions. The study aims to understand how Ayurveda's holistic philosophy integrates individual health with ecological considerations, using qualitative methods including interviews with ten Ayurvedic physicians from India. Findings indicate that the dosha framework facilitates a comprehensive approach, linking mind-body awareness with lifestyle choices and ecological contexts. The study concludes that natural cycles and environmental factors play a crucial role in patient assessment and self-management, advocating for a collaborative care model that empowers patients by connecting their personal experiences with broader ecological influences. Recommendations include fostering patient ownership of care through the dosha framework, enhancing the integration of individual and ecological aspects in chronic pain management."
