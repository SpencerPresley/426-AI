    "detailed_summary": "This research investigates the advance care planning (ACP) process, which includes understanding and preparing for end-of-life decisions, documenting preferences through Advance Directives (ADs), and discussing these preferences with family. The study highlights that Chinese Americans experience unique cultural challenges that contribute to lower engagement in ACP and AD completion rates compared to other ethnic minorities. The objective was to assess the effectiveness of a culturally tailored, nurse-led educational workshop on attitudes towards ADs and the completion of ADs and ACP discussions. Utilizing a pre-posttest, repeated measures non-experimental design, the study involved 72 Chinese American participants who attended workshops in both English and Mandarin at a community center. Surveys were conducted before, immediately after, and one month post-workshop. Results indicated that attitudes towards ADs improved significantly after the workshop and remained stable at the follow-up. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between these attitudes and both AD completion and ACP discussions. The findings suggest that nurse-driven interventions can effectively increase ACP engagement in Chinese Americans, a demographic often perceived as reluctant to engage in discussions about death. The study concludes that culturally tailored approaches are essential for enhancing participation in the ACP process."
