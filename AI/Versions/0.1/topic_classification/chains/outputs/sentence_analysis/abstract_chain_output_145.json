    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the phenomenon of firms voluntarily adopting green management practices in response to societal concerns about environmental protection. It highlights how these practices often extend beyond legal requirements and may not yield immediate benefits. The authors leverage the concept of corporate loss aversion to argue that firms performing better than their peers are likely to take on more risks to avoid losing their competitive advantage, leading them to engage more in stakeholder management through green initiatives. The study specifically focuses on the Green Power Partnership (GPP), which encourages firms to purchase green power. By analyzing data on green power consumption among GPP participants in the United States, the authors find that firms exceeding social performance benchmarks are more inclined to increase their green power usage. Additionally, they discover that related diversification negatively impacts the motivation to adopt such practices, suggesting that firms with a broader range of related business activities may be less focused on environmental initiatives."
