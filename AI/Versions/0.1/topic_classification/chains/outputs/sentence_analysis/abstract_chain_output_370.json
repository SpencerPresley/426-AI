    "detailed_summary": "This study examines the effects of climate change and land use on the adult sex ratios of spotted turtles, a species with temperature-dependent sex determination. The researchers sampled turtles across a wide geographic range from Florida to Maine, finding evidence that climate change may skew sex ratios towards females in warmer areas, while cooler areas showed a male-biased trend with rising temperatures. The study suggests that these patterns may be influenced by the turtles' adaptive capacity in nest site selection and highlights a context-dependent relationship with land use. Specifically, a negative correlation between male proportions and crop cover was observed when wetlands were less aggregated, while consistent sex ratios were found in more aggregated wetland areas. The findings indicate that male turtles may be more vulnerable to threats from agricultural practices due to movement patterns. Overall, the research emphasizes the complex interplay between climate change, land use, and landscape structure in shaping wildlife demographics."
