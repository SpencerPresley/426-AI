The research is centered on a low tidal energy salt marsh within the Paul S.

A comprehensive methodology involving aerial surveys with UAVs was implemented to achieve high-resolution mapping, using advanced algorithms like Structure-from-Motion and Multi-View-Stereo for 3D reconstruction. The study evaluates channel morphology and elevation changes using various mapping technologies. Results indicate that the employed workflow is effective for monitoring geomorphological changes in micro-tidal systems, though dense vegetation posed challenges. The UAV-based photogrammetry approach, combined with GNSS RTK surveys, is deemed replicable for global application in restoration evaluations and shoreline management strategies."
