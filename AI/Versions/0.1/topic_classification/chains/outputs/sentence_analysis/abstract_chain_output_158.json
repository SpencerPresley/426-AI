A total of 586 participants were recruited for the OPREVENT2 study, and their physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. Results indicated that the average age of participants was 45.8 years, with a body mass index of 31.5 kg/m\u00b2. The findings showed that men engaged in more vigorous activity than women, both in terms of frequency and duration, and that a significant percentage of both genders met the recommended physical activity guidelines. Despite adequate walking time, the study concludes that there is a need for interventions to enhance moderate- and vigorous-intensity fitness, muscular strength, endurance, and flexibility among Native Americans."
