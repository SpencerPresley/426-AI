    "detailed_summary": "This study examines the role of Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), a chemical present in many consumer products, as a potential obesogen. Through in vivo testing in a mouse model, the researchers administered DOSS to pregnant mice at doses relevant to human exposure during pregnancy. The results indicated that male offspring of DOSS-treated mothers exhibited significant increases in body weight and fat, alongside metabolic disorders characterized by hormonal imbalances and inflammation. The study also observed changes in lipid profiles that resembled those seen in obesity induced by high-fat diets. These findings suggest that DOSS exposure during critical developmental periods may have lasting effects on metabolic health, raising concerns about its use in products consumed by pregnant women and its contribution to obesity-related health issues in their children."
