    "overall_theme": "The research examines how various social exchange relationships within organizations influence Chinese workers' attitudes toward strikes, highlighting the significance of negative perceptions in shaping these attitudes.",
    "detailed_summary": "The research paper investigates the factors influencing Chinese workers' attitudes toward labor strikes, particularly in the context of multinational corporations in China. It utilizes social exchange theory to analyze three types of relationships: employee-employer, labor-management, and leader-member relations. A sample of over 1,600 employees from 41 China-based MNCs was used, and the findings were analyzed through hierarchical linear modeling. The results indicated that negative perceptions of employee-employer relations increase favorable attitudes toward strikes, while positive labor-management relations decrease such attitudes. Interestingly, leader-member relations showed no significant impact on strike attitudes. The study concludes that it is crucial for companies to avoid negative interactions with employees to mitigate strike attitudes, suggesting that the absence of bad practices may be more effective than the presence of good ones."
