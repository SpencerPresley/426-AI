    "detailed_summary": "The research paper focuses on the Draco C1 binary star system, which consists of a carbon red giant and a likely white dwarf, located in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Using near-infrared spectroscopic observations from the APOGEE-2 project, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV, the authors updated the stellar parameters for the red giant and constrained the temperature and mass of its compact companion. Previous studies had only established a lower limit for the orbital period of the system (greater than 300 days) due to limited data. In contrast, this research presents precise orbital parameters for the first time, determining the period of the system to be approximately 1220 days based on 43 radial velocity measurements over more than three years. The findings suggest that the hot companion is likely accreting material from the red giant's dense stellar wind, highlighting the interactions within this binary system."
