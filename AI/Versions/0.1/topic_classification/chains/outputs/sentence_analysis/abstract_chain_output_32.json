    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the conflict between corporate disclosures and actions, particularly focusing on the relationship between tax avoidance and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and their joint effect on economic outcomes. The authors evaluate how investors perceive companies when tax avoidance conflicts with CSR initiatives, finding that tax avoidance generally has a negative influence on investment decisions. Interestingly, while CSR alone does not seem to impact these decisions, its presence can mitigate the negative effects of tax avoidance. The study also reveals that a firm's CSR and tax avoidance policies lead to varying investment intentions, largely driven by individuals' personal beliefs about ethics and CSR. Ultimately, the findings suggest that promoting stakeholder values can protect companies from the adverse consequences of tax avoidance, emphasizing the significant role of individual attitudes in shaping perceptions of corporate behavior."
