    "detailed_summary": "This research article investigates how the core competencies of enterprises influence the maturity of IT applications (ITAM), specifically through management institutional and process management capabilities. It also examines the effects of firm ownership and ISO certifications. Data was collected from 123 companies in China using reliable metrics for ITAM and management capabilities. The findings indicate a positive correlation between management capabilities and ITAM. Notably, management institutional capability is more influential in state-owned enterprises, while process management capability is more significant in multinational firms. Additionally, ISO certification aids firms with lower management capabilities in enhancing ITAM, but for those with higher management capacities, ISO reduces its impact and shifts the focus towards process management for ITAM improvement."
