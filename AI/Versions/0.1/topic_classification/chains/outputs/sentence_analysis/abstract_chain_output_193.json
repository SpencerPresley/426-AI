    "detailed_summary": "This research paper discusses the limitations of traditional beta regression models when the dependent variable can take on values of 0 and 1. To address these limitations, the authors propose a new class of regression models that treat the dependent variable as a continuous range from 0 to 1. This approach is a significant development in the literature, allowing for a more nuanced analysis of such data. The authors employ a Bayesian estimation method, examining how different prior distributions influence empirical findings. Additionally, they conduct a simulation study to assess the model's fit, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their proposed methodology."
