    "detailed_summary": "This paper investigates how firms can build resilience against business risks stemming from supply chain disruptions through the development of big data analytics (BDA) capabilities. The authors examine the mediating role of BDA in the relationship between institutional responses to disruptions and information technology infrastructure capabilities (ITICs), focusing on the implications for risk resilience. Based on survey data from 225 firms across various sectors in the USA and Europe, the study's respondents include senior and middle management professionals with expertise in IT and supply chain management. The researchers employed validity and reliability analyses, along with covariance-based structural equation modeling, to test their hypotheses. The findings reveal two critical insights: firstly, that institutional experience with managing disruptions negatively affects a firm's resilience; and secondly, that adopting BDA capabilities allows organizations to leverage existing knowledge effectively, enhancing their risk resilience. Additionally, the study finds that BDA contributes positively to IT capabilities and mediates the relationship between ITIC and resilience development. This research is notable for its empirical validation of the critical role of BDA in fostering resilience, challenging the prevailing view that past experience prepares firms for future disruptions, and ultimately enriching the understanding of the interplay between BDA and supply chain risk resilience."
