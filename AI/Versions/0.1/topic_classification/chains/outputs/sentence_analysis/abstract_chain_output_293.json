    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the role of mangroves in protecting coastal communities from economic damages caused by cyclones. It identifies that communities suffering from mangrove deforestation are increasingly vulnerable to economic losses. Previous studies have only examined the benefits of mangroves through isolated case studies, lacking a comprehensive perspective. The authors utilized spatial data and statistical methods to analyze the impact of cyclones on nearly 2,000 communities in 23 countries from 2000 to 2012. They employed nighttime luminosity to measure economic activity trends, discovering that communities with average mangrove coverage faced permanent economic losses of 5.4-6.7 months after cyclone exposure, while those with more extensive mangroves experienced lesser losses of 2.6-5.5 months. The study concludes that investing in mangrove restoration could be more cost-effective and that the detrimental effects of mangrove loss are more severe than previously recognized."
