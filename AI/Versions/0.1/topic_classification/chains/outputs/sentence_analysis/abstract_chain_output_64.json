    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the link between women's sexual satisfaction with their current partner and their history of sexual victimization, specifically examining the role of the current partner as a potential perpetrator. A sample of 412 undergraduate women from a U.S. public university participated in the study, responding to surveys measuring sexual satisfaction and experiences of victimization from 2012 to 2016. The results from a 2 x 2 ANOVA indicated that sexual victimization by the current partner was significantly associated with lower sexual satisfaction, while victimization by others did not show this same effect. The findings suggest that the context of the victimization experience is important, as it may impact the victim's perception and satisfaction with their partner. The study emphasizes the need for further research into how partner-related factors can influence sexual health outcomes."
