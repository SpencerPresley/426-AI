    "detailed_summary": "This population-based study focuses on older women (ages 70-90) diagnosed with early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy but omitted radiation therapy. Utilizing the SEER-Medicare database, the researchers analyzed the initiation and patterns of endocrine therapy using multivariable logistic regression and examined overall survival outcomes with Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazard models. The findings revealed that 30.9% of the patients did not receive endocrine therapy, and that while ET initiation improved in recent years, older patients were less likely to start treatment. Statistical analyses indicated that receiving endocrine therapy was associated with better survival rates. The study concludes that many patients who forwent radiation therapy also missed out on potentially beneficial endocrine therapy, highlighting an important area for clinical attention and intervention."
