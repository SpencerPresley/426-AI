            "sentence": "In this study, we partition the joint provision of nonaudit services (NAS) into audit-related, tax, and all other services, and examine whether these services have varying impacts on independence-in-appearance, as measured by earnings response coefficients, over an extended period following the enactment of SOX.",
            "meaning": "The research investigates how different types of nonaudit services affect the perceived independence of auditors over time after the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was enacted.",

            "sentence": "Prior research examining independence-in-appearance generally focuses on the years surrounding SOX and uses an aggregate NAS measure despite anecdotal and experimental evidence that there may be heterogeneity in how investors perceive different types of NAS.",

    "overall_theme": "The research investigates the differentiated impact of various types of nonaudit services on investor perceptions of auditor independence, particularly in the context of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.",
    "detailed_summary": "This study partitions nonaudit services (NAS) into three categories: audit-related, tax, and other services, to explore their distinct impacts on independence-in-appearance as measured by earnings response coefficients following the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). It critiques prior research for using an aggregate NAS measure and failing to account for the varying investor perceptions of different NAS types. The findings reveal that while an aggregate measure does not significantly affect earnings response coefficients, audit-related NAS is viewed negatively by investors, whereas tax NAS is perceived positively, resulting in an overall neutral effect when combined. The results are particularly influenced by firms with high accruals and smaller firms. Additionally, the study highlights that existing measures of financial dependence do not fully explain the effects of NAS on investor perceptions and suggests that the positive perception of tax NAS is linked to its impact on a firm's tax strategies."
