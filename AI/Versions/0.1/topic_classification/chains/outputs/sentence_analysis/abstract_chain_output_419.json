    "detailed_summary": "The research paper examines the fluctuating role of probability in children's curricula over recent decades, noting that some countries have removed it while others retain it. This inconsistency is attributed to the nascent nature of theories surrounding early probability learning. The report aims to propose a tentative theoretical structure to guide educational decisions and future research. The authors review existing literature, focusing on the probabilistic thinking tendencies of young children. They identify two distinct cycles of probabilistic thinking: one that aligns with accepted educational norms and supports conventional reasoning, and another that fosters misconceptions and non-scientific beliefs. Empirical data from design-based research is used to illustrate these cycles. Ultimately, the authors suggest that their framework, the Structure of Early Probabilistic Thinking (SEPT), can serve as a foundation for future curricular and theoretical advancements in the field."
