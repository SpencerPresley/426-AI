    "detailed_summary": "This research investigates how perceived job insecurity, a significant source of stress, affects subjective sleep quality, which serves as an important health indicator. The study employs job stress concepts and a perseverative cognition model, focusing on negative work spillover as a mediator. It hypothesizes that the relationship between job insecurity and sleep quality may be moderated by gender, predicting a stronger effect for men. Two studies are conducted, with Study 1 utilizing a sample of 1031 working adults from a national survey and employing multi-group path analysis. The results indicate that negative work spillover mediates the relationship between perceived job insecurity and sleep quality. Study 2, involving 152 working adults surveyed biweekly, replicates these findings. However, neither study finds evidence of gender moderation in the relationship. The paper concludes with discussions on theoretical and methodological contributions, limitations, and future research directions."
