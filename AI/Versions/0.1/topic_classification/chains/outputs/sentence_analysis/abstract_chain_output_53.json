    "detailed_summary": "This research explores the relationship between resilience, academic burnout, and psychological distress in a sample of US undergraduate accounting majors. It builds on previous studies, particularly by Garcia-Izquierdo et al. (2018), and employs a survey administered to 443 students across four universities. Two models are tested: one where resilience is an external predictor of burnout affecting distress, and another where distress influences burnout. Results show that resilience is negatively associated with psychological distress and burnout dimensions, while emotional exhaustion and academic inefficacy positively correlate with distress. The second model indicates resilience moderates the relationship between distress and academic inefficacy. Ultimately, the findings suggest resilience serves as a compensatory mechanism, crucial for mitigating the effects of academic challenges on mental health."
