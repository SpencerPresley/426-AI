    "detailed_summary": "This research paper analyzes Aravind Adiga's novel 'The White Tiger', which won the Booker Prize in 2008, through the concept of justice encompassing philosophical, legal, and literary dimensions. It raises questions about the nature of justice when enacted by a subaltern individual who is marginalized by caste and class, and argues that the representation of social issues like class, caste, poverty, and violence in the novel reflects broader constructs of justice. The author emphasizes that Adiga's narrative perspective aligns with the calls from Dalit critics for a reconfiguration of modernity that focuses on the experiences of the oppressed. Additionally, the paper advocates for a rethinking of postcolonial literary criticism that centers on internal perspectives rather than traditional narratives of colonial oppression. The essay seeks to provoke discussions about the implications of justice and human rights as portrayed in literary fiction and through subaltern and deconstructive theories. It concludes by questioning how writers can represent justice while engaging with existing philosophical and legal frameworks, referencing several prominent theorists to support the analysis."
