    "detailed_summary": "The study addresses the threats faced by amphibian populations due to human activities, particularly the spread of the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) and urbanization, which contribute to the decline in global amphibian biodiversity. Recognizing the slow nature of traditional evolutionary processes, the research focuses on the more rapid epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation, as a means for amphibians to adapt to environmental changes. The research specifically examines four populations of tungara frogs in Gamboa, Panama, differing in fungal prevalence and urbanization levels. DNA samples were collected from mating pairs and analyzed using a methylation-sensitive technique. The findings revealed significant variations in DNA methylation among the populations and established correlations between Bd infection status and methylation patterns, while urbanization did not affect methylation frequency. The results suggest that epigenetic modifications can adapt flexibly to environmental changes and indicate potential biological links between DNA methylation and Bd infection. Ultimately, the research provides a foundation for future studies exploring the causal relationship between epigenetics and phenotypic responses to human-induced environmental changes."
