    "detailed_summary": "This research examines how software vendors are related to application security risks stemming from software vulnerabilities, utilizing data from the China National Vulnerability Database (CNNVD). Initially, the study classifies software vendors into three categories using a latent class model. Following this, regression models are employed to analyze the relationships between software vulnerabilities and application security risks for each vendor category. The results reveal that these relationships differ among vendors, suggesting that IT vendors should focus on understanding specific vulnerability characteristics relevant to their category to mitigate the generation of vulnerabilities in their products effectively."
