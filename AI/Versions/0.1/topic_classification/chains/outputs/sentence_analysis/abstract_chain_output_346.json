    "detailed_summary": "This research paper presents initial findings from a five-year study utilizing draw-a-scientist tests (DASTs) to evaluate how 8-10 week astronomy clubs and one-week summer camps influence the perceptions of scientists among 3rd-5th grade elementary students. The study involved administering DASTs before and after the programs to establish a baseline and measure any changes in students' conceptions of scientists. A total of 89 pairs of DASTs were analyzed using a numerical grading scheme to quantify various features in the drawings. Key findings reveal a gender imbalance, with only 32% of pre-club and 35% of post-club drawings depicting female scientists. Additionally, a significant proportion of the scientists drawn exhibit stereotypical appearances and activities. While most categories showed insignificant changes, there was an 8% increase in stereotypical appearances and a significant 12% decrease in stereotypical activities. The paper concludes with suggestions for improving the implementation of DASTs and explores other assessment methods that may more effectively gauge the impact of the astronomy clubs and camps."
