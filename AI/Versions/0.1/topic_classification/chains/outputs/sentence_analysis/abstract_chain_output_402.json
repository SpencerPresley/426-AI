    "detailed_summary": "This meta-analysis explores how emotional intelligence affects organizational citizenship behavior and counterproductive work behavior across various cultural dimensions. It finds that the emotional intelligence-organizational citizenship behavior relationship is particularly strong in long-term oriented and restraint cultures, while remaining consistent across individualistic and collectivistic cultures, as well as other cultural dimensions like power distance and uncertainty avoidance. Conversely, the emotional intelligence-counterproductive work behavior relationship is more pronounced in collectivistic, feminine, and cultures with high uncertainty avoidance and power distance. Both relationships are mediated by individuals' positive and negative emotional states. The study recommends that HR professionals in cultures where emotional intelligence has a stronger effect should focus on hiring emotionally intelligent employees and offering emotional intelligence training. Overall, the findings suggest that emotional intelligence broadly promotes positive workplace behaviors and mitigates negative ones, despite significant cross-cultural differences."
