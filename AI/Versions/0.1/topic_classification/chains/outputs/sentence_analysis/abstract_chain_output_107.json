            "reasoning": "The terms 'new mathematical model' and 'proposed and investigated' indicate that this is an original contribution to the field, while 'diffusive FitzHugh-Nagumo equations' and 'memristors' specify the model's components.",

            "reasoning": "The phrase 'existence of absorbing set' suggests a proof of stability or boundedness in the solutions, while 'global dynamics ... are dissipative' indicates that the system loses energy over time.",

    "detailed_summary": "The paper introduces a new mathematical model for neural networks based on diffusive FitzHugh-Nagumo equations, enhanced with memristors and linear synaptic coupling. The authors prove the existence of an absorbing set for the solution semiflow in the energy space, indicating stability in the network's dynamics, which are characterized as dissipative. Furthermore, they establish that exponential synchronization can occur at a uniform rate, contingent upon the coupling strength meeting a specific threshold defined by the system parameters. This theoretical framework is corroborated by numerical simulations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior and its implications for neural network dynamics."
