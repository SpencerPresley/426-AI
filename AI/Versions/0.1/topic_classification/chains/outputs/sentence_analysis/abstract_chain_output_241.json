The researchers utilized a variety of data collection methods, including interviews, classroom observations, and text analyses, to gather comprehensive insights. Through a multi-cycle coding approach, the study identifies key findings that reveal schools and teachers as the primary literacy sponsors, while the roles of parents and local literacies remain largely unrecognized. Two significant aspects of sponsorship were identified: the importance of interpersonal relationships and a reliance on standardized English language arts curricula that lack local relevance. Participants tended to prioritize established educational practices over local texts, reflecting a commitment to traditional educational values that may stifle critical perspectives. The study concludes by calling for literacy educators to consider rural learners as central to their work, advocating for a more inclusive approach at both policy and research levels."
