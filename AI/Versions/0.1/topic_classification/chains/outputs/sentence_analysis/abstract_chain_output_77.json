    "detailed_summary": "This research paper explores how right-slanted fonts can effectively communicate promotions to consumers, thereby increasing store traffic and purchase intentions. The authors propose that the design of these fonts, which suggests forward movement, may positively influence consumer perceptions of promotional events. Through five controlled experiments, the study demonstrates that promotions using right-slanted fonts lead to higher intentions of visiting retailers and making purchases. Additionally, a field experiment shows that these fonts can improve click-through rates in email promotions. The findings indicate that right-slanted fonts create dynamic mental imagery, evoking a sense of urgency, particularly among deal-prone consumers who may experience regret over missing out on promotional offers. However, the influence of these fonts is limited to contexts where there is a promotional offer present."
