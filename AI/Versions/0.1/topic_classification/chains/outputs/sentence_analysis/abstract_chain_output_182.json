    "detailed_summary": "This study evaluates the effectiveness of adhesive tapes in monitoring the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) and ghost ant (Tapinoma melanocephalum) in urban areas of southern China. Although adhesive tapes were found to be as effective as traditional methods such as baits and pitfall traps for detecting these species, they were less successful at capturing non-target ant species. The research builds on previous findings that these ants exhibit paving behavior, where they manipulate materials to aid in foraging. A total of 3998 adhesive tapes with food sources were deployed across 20 locations in Guangzhou, and the detection rates of S. invicta were similar for both baits and adhesive tapes. The study also found that a number of non-target ant species exhibited similar paving behavior but could be distinguished morphologically from the target species. Overall, the findings suggest that paving behavior could be utilized to develop more specific monitoring strategies for S. invicta and T. melanocephalum in urban environments."
