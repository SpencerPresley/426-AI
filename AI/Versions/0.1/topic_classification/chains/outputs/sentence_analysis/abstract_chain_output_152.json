    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates how patients communicate their pain experiences within the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) provider-patient relationship. The study identifies a gap in understanding the impact of patient communication on both psychological and physical pain. Through qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 13 CAM patients, the research reveals that patients articulate their pain experiences by acknowledging their interconnectedness with relational, physical, and physiological spaces. The findings suggest that fostering a therapeutic relationship that emphasizes this interdependence can enhance patients' awareness and acceptance of their bodies. Ultimately, the study highlights the significance of CAM providers in facilitating patients' control over their environments, relationships, and bodily functions, thereby redefining their pain experiences."
