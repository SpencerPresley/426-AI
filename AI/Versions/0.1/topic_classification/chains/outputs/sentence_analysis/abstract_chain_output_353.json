    "detailed_summary": "This study explores the functional impact of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) on neuronal activity in the cerebellum and motor cortex using the SMND7 mouse model. It identifies significant differences in neuronal function across two age groups (P7-9 and P11-14), revealing lower spontaneous firing and network activity in the cerebellum, particularly in older mice, while the motor cortex showed no differences in activity. Whole-cell patch-clamp analysis indicated changes in the electrical properties of cerebellar Purkinje cells and stable properties in motor cortex layer V pyramidal neurons. The action potential thresholds were depolarized in the older group, and there was reduced synaptic activity in both brain regions. These findings suggest developmental alterations in the neural network associated with SMA, indicating that neuronal dysfunction in these areas may contribute to the disease's pathology. The results advocate for considering treatment strategies that target not only the spinal cord but also the affected brain regions to improve outcomes for SMA patients."
