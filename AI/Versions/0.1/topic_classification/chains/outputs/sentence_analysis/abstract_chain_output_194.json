    "detailed_summary": "The study investigates the implementation of engineering practices in preschool settings, capitalizing on young children's natural curiosity during a critical developmental period. It defines engineering as a goal-oriented problem-solving process that involves hands-on activities and collaborative learning, which can enhance critical thinking and creativity. Despite the growing literature on early engineering education, there remains a lack of concrete examples and reflections on classroom implementation. The study aims to fill this gap by documenting the experiences of a preschool teacher and students aged 3 to 5, including those with developmental delays, as they engage in four engineering challenges over four weeks. The teacher's reflections underscore the value of these activities in fostering collaboration and skill development among diverse learners. The research concludes with recommendations for early childhood educators on effectively incorporating engineering experiences into their teaching practice, emphasizing the importance of inquiry-driven methods and the teacher's role in facilitating student participation."
