    "detailed_summary": "This study focuses on the experiences of parents of pre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) children, particularly their decision-making processes about disclosing their children's identities to extended family members. It consists of two phases: the first involved interviews with 34 parents, while the second expanded the findings with 11 additional participants. The research identified two main disclosure processes: casual unfolding, where parents let family members observe their child's identity development, and explicit direct disclosure, often through written communication. Factors such as geographical distance, emotional ties, age, and conservative or religious beliefs influenced parents' decisions to disclose or withhold information. The effects of disclosure varied, with some relationships strengthening and others becoming strained or ending. Overall, the findings highlight the dual roles of extended family as potential supporters and stressors, and the strategies parents employ to navigate these challenges. The implications of the study extend to social work research and practice, emphasizing the need for supportive frameworks for families of TGNC youth."
