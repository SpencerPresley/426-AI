    "detailed_summary": "This study focuses on the communication systems of female tungara frogs and fringelipped bats, which utilize acoustic signals to locate male frogs. In addition to these sounds, vocal sac inflation and water ripples also contribute to detection and decision-making. The authors highlight a gap in understanding the natural variation and correlation of these three components. To address this, they conducted detailed recordings of calling males, measuring call amplitude, vocal sac volume, and water ripple height across 54 frogs, totaling 2430 calls. The results indicated significant correlations among the measures, particularly a strong association between vocal sac volume and call amplitude. Furthermore, multimodal models that incorporated all three signals proved to be more effective in predicting the mass of calling males than unimodal models. These findings underscore the interconnectedness of multimodal communication components and set the stage for future research on how receivers interpret complex displays."
