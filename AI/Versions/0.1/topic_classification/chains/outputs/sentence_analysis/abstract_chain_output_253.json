While there is a substantial amount of research in this area, the specific impact of these partnerships on the financial valuation of retail firms has not been thoroughly explored. Utilizing a resource-based view, the authors investigate how third-party delivery firms create value through their unique capabilities. The results from an event study indicate that, on average, these partnerships enhance firm performance. However, the analysis reveals that the benefits are not uniformly distributed; factors such as the density of firms in the marketplace and the level of service provided by retailers can influence the extent of the advantages gained from these partnerships."
