    "detailed_summary": "This study explores the impact of noise on the communication of female tungara frogs, particularly how they respond to male advertisement calls when visual signals are present. The researchers hypothesized that multimodal signals would enhance the frogs' ability to detect and discriminate calls in noisy settings. They conducted experiments at two levels of complexity, with two-choice and three-choice tests. Results showed that in two-choice tests, noise did not diminish preferences for attractive calls, and the presence of a visual signal with an unattractive call did not alter preferences in quiet conditions. However, in noisy environments, females were more likely to select an unattractive call if accompanied by a visual component. In three-choice tests, noise significantly reduced responses to attractive calls, irrespective of visual signals. The findings suggest that the efficacy of multimodal signals may not be as beneficial in noisy environments as previously thought, indicating that the complexity of the sensory scene plays a critical role in audio-visual perception and cognitive processing in mate choice decisions."
