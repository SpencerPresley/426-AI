    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the role of collaborative partnering between state departments of transportation and aviation construction projects, demonstrating that such partnerships lead to significant reductions in claims and improvements in project schedules. Despite the empirical evidence supporting these benefits, partnering remains underutilized and often misunderstood in the context of airport construction, which involves complex stakeholder dynamics and regulatory challenges. The study aims to describe current practices of partnering in the aviation construction industry and gather insights through a comprehensive survey of professionals involved in these projects across the United States. The findings indicate that experienced participants in partnered aviation projects perceive notable enhancements in safety and fewer claims, although many projects are still in the early stages of adopting these practices. The paper asserts that partnering is beneficial for airport projects, regardless of their delivery method or budget, and highlights that those with more experience in certain project delivery methods are more likely to recognize improvements. Ultimately, the research underscores the importance of fostering trust and collaboration among organizations and emphasizes the potential of partnering to improve team integration, stakeholder management, and risk mitigation in aviation construction projects."
