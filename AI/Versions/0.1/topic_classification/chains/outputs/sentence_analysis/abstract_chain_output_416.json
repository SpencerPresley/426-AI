    "detailed_summary": "This research paper highlights the critical public health issue of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the United States, particularly among commercial drivers who face a higher incidence of CVD compared to the general population. The study identifies significant barriers to screening, such as lack of insurance and primary care, which affect one-third of commercial drivers. With nearly 3.5 million commercial drivers in the U.S., the study emphasizes the urgency of addressing their healthcare needs due to the correlation between CVD and increased motor vehicle accidents, fatalities, and healthcare costs. An evidence-based practice (EBP) project was conducted, utilizing the non-laboratory Framingham CVD risk score calculator to screen over 90% of drivers during mandatory medical examinations and educate them about modifiable risk factors over a two-month period. The findings revealed that over 40% of drivers were at high risk for CVD, with notable percentages uninsured or without primary care. The average risk score for these drivers was double that of the general population, with obesity, hypertension, and smoking identified as the primary risk factors. The study concludes that incorporating CVD risk screening and education during routine medical encounters is a logical and cost-effective strategy that aligns with occupational health standards, ultimately promoting health and safety for this essential workforce."
