    "detailed_summary": "This study utilized compound-specific isotope analysis of carbon isotopes in amino acids to explore the biosynthetic origins of amino acids in fish from key tributaries of California's Sacramento-San Joaquin river delta. Samples were collected during winter and spring over a span of three years, confirming the significant role of algae in the floodplain food webs of California's Central Valley. While bulk stable isotope analysis provided insights into the general trophic structure and migration patterns of species like American shad and rainbow trout, it proved inadequate for traditional mixing models due to the variability in isotope compositions. The findings from the compound-specific analysis indicated that algae are crucial organic matter sources for conservation-sensitive fish, such as Chinook salmon, but also revealed that other sources like bacteria, fungi, and higher plants contribute to these ecosystems. Ultimately, while the study supports the established view of algae's importance, it also suggests that detrital subsidies may occasionally play a role in supporting metazoan food webs."
