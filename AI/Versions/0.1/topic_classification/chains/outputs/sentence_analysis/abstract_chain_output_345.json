    "detailed_summary": "This study assessed the impact of two resistance training models on arterial stiffness in 24 untrained college women aged 18-22. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group or one of two resistance training groups (high-intensity and high-volume), with training conducted 3-5 days per week for 11 weeks. The high-intensity group performed fewer repetitions at a higher percentage of their one-repetition maximum, while the high-volume group did more repetitions at a lower intensity. All participants maintained their usual diet and avoided cardiovascular exercises. Results indicated that the control group experienced significant increases in arterial stiffness, while both resistance training groups showed notable improvements in strength across various exercises. The study concludes that resistance training can enhance strength without adversely affecting vascular compliance in healthy women."
