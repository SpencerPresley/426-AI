A sample of 479 undergraduate women completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the SES-SFV to assess their experiences and self-esteem levels. Results indicate that women who experienced criticism reported significantly lower self-esteem compared to those who did not, while the experience of threats showed no significant relationship with self-esteem. These findings support previous suggestions that criticism is a more harmful form of verbal coercion than threats. The study concludes with a recommendation for future research to carefully define verbal coercion to enhance the clarity and accuracy of findings in this area."
