Utilizing data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances, the authors apply ordinary least squares regression and a Heckman selection model to analyze individual investors' direct stock holdings. The findings indicate that higher income, greater education, male gender, being non-white, and increased risk tolerance correlate with a higher risk of endowment bias. Additionally, a profile of investors prone to home bias is identified, characterized by lower financial sophistication, lower net worth, older age, female gender, higher risk aversion, positive domestic economic expectations, and shorter investment horizons. This study is significant as it leverages directly reported stock holdings from US investors to explore individual characteristics linked to familiarity bias, providing valuable insights for financial professionals on how to effectively educate diverse clients."
