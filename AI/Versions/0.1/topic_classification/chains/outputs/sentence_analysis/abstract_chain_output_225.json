    "summary": "This study explores the role of mobile money (MM) in strengthening the resilience of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. It identifies a lack of documented evidence supporting the benefits of MM for SMEs, despite its potential. Utilizing Enterprise Survey data from Zambia, the research finds that SMEs are more susceptible to severe sales declines compared to larger firms, indicating their vulnerability. However, the study also reveals that this negative impact can be alleviated when SMEs adopt mobile money in their daily operations. The findings suggest that integrating digital technologies into policy responses is essential for addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic."
