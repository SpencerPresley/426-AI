    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the automobile consumption credit business in China, highlighting its role in promoting the automobile industry while noting the need for improvements in the credit system. It addresses the risks linked to loan defaults that adversely affect company profits. The study employs economic and financial theories to develop a logistic model aimed at predicting customer default probabilities. Additionally, a quadratic regression model is created to identify an optimal commission structure that balances profitability with retail incentives. The results indicate that macro-level variables negatively influence responsible borrowing behavior, while personal-level variables positively correlate with it. Furthermore, the findings reveal an inverted 'U' relationship between profit and commission, suggesting that excessive commissions may harm profits. The paper concludes with recommendations based on these insights."
