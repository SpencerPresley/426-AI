The research highlights the importance of neuroglia in nervous system therapies and notes that while artificial CSF is available, traditional cell culture media is still commonly used in tissue engineering. The authors created defined microenvironments for glial cells using a microfluidic device, demonstrating that EBS supports Schwann cell survival and growth similarly to traditional media, while also promoting chemotactic responses to brain-derived growth factor (BDNF). The results indicate significant movement of Schwann cells toward BDNF gradients and show that spinal cord explants cultured in EBS exhibit neurite growth consistent with in vivo measurements. The findings suggest that incorporating CSF replacement fluids like EBS can significantly enhance the study of cellular behaviors and contribute to the advancement of regenerative therapies for nervous system disorders."
