    "detailed_summary": "This study focuses on cycloxaprid, a newly discovered neonicotinoid insecticide, and its effectiveness in controlling the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta. The research compares cycloxaprid with two commonly used insecticides, imidacloprid and bifenthrin. Results indicate that all three insecticides lead to high mortality rates among fire ant workers, although cycloxaprid and imidacloprid act more slowly than bifenthrin. Cycloxaprid can be transferred between ants, similar to the other two insecticides. While cycloxaprid and imidacloprid enhance the activities of certain enzymes in ants, they do not significantly alter their foraging or digging behaviors. Interestingly, ants showed a preference for digging in sand treated with low concentrations of cycloxaprid. Extensive nesting activities were also observed in untreated sand and sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid, while bifenthrin negatively impacted all behaviors assessed. The study concludes that cycloxaprid is a slow-acting, nonrepellent insecticide with slightly higher toxicities than imidacloprid, making it a potential alternative for managing fire ant populations."
