    "detailed_summary": "This study examines the contributions of intestinal microbiota to amino acid metabolism in mice, focusing on how these microbes convert carbohydrates into essential amino acids (AA(ESS)) that the host uses for muscle tissue synthesis. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbon isotope analysis, the researchers found that the composition of gut microbiota, specifically the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, varied with dietary macromolecular content. Firmicutes were more prevalent in low-protein, high-carbohydrate diets. The results indicated that the contribution of gut microbiota to essential amino acids varied widely, with some amino acids receiving minimal contributions while others, such as valine, received significant amounts. Overall, the findings underscore the critical role of gut microbiota in providing essential amino acids, particularly in the context of protein-deficient diets, suggesting that this aspect is an important yet under-recognized element of animal foraging ecology and physiology."
