The study employs a quantitative content analysis of one year\u2019s coverage from four local NPR affiliates to compare Hearken's audience-driven content with traditional reporter-driven journalism across several categories, including hyperlocal coverage and representation of underrepresented communities. The findings indicate that Hearken content tends to favor lifestyle topics in hyperlocal news, contrasting with traditional journalism's focus on governance, politics, and crime. This disparity highlights a significant difference between what audiences desire and what journalists typically report. The study concludes by discussing the complex implications of Hearken's model of 'deep participation', examining both its potential benefits and limitations."
