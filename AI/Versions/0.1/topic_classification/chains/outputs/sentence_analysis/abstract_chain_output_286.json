    "detailed_summary": "The research comprises two studies exploring the relationships between humor styles and several psychological and social outcomes, including well-being, social support, cognitive reappraisal, and social competence. Study 1, involving 108 participants, found that self-enhancing and affiliative humor were linked to fewer health issues and less psychological distress, mediated by cognitive reappraisal and social support. Conversely, self-defeating humor was associated with greater distress, and aggressive humor's relationship with social support was moderated by social competence. Study 2 tracked 193 undergraduates over ten weeks, replicating the findings from Study 1 regarding psychological distress. It confirmed that social support and reappraisal mediated the relationships between humor styles and distress, while aggressive humor was linked to health difficulties. Additionally, self-defeating humor predicted worsening health over time. The studies suggest that communication difficulties impact the relationship between aggressive humor and social interactions, and the overall findings remain robust when accounting for shared variance in humor styles."
