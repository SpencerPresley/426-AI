A total of 1,005 women participated in the study, completing validated scales to measure body-esteem and self-esteem. The findings reveal that women who experienced rape within the past year reported significantly lower levels of both body-esteem and self-esteem compared to those who were raped earlier and nonvictims. Interestingly, women who were raped earlier did not show significant differences in self-esteem levels compared to nonvictims. Furthermore, the labeling status of the rape did not significantly affect the outcomes. Ultimately, the study identifies recent rape as a critical factor associated with diminished body-esteem and self-esteem."
