    "detailed_summary": "The research paper addresses the increasing risks associated with creating and delivering value in complex supply chain networks. It identifies a gap in the understanding of strategy development under business risk conditions. The study employs a cross-country approach, utilizing literature reviews and surveys of managers from global firms to explore how these companies develop effective risk management practices in the face of supply chain network risks. The findings reveal that management tends to adopt a cautious decision-making approach during uncertain times, waiting for visible risks to materialize before implementing prudent response strategies. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the vital role of supply chain exploration and exploitation practices in shaping network risk management, ultimately leading to improved financial outcomes for firms."
