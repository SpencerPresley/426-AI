    "detailed_summary": "This research paper discusses the concept of intersectionality, which was introduced by Kimberle Williams Crenshaw in the late 1980s to enhance legal and epistemological perspectives for individuals experiencing multiple forms of oppression, including racism and sexism. The theory has since expanded into various academic and public domains worldwide. The author of the article focuses on Crenshaw's original ideas and applies them to the experiences of Sikhs in both the US and India, who are considered multiply minoritized. The paper proposes six theoretical formations\u2014intrgroup solidarity, intergroup alliances, postsecularism, untranslatability, precarity, and intellectual intersectionality\u2014that together create a framework termed intersectional Sikhism, which seeks to deepen the understanding of the Sikh experience through the lens of intersectionality."
