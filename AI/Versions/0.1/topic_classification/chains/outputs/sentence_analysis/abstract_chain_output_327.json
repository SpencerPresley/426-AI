    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses a study that addresses the lack of research on the relationship between body-esteem and sexual victimization in adulthood. The study involved 750 undergraduate women who were assessed using the Body-Esteem Scale and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization. The results showed that women with no sexual victimization experience and those with sexual contact experience had similar and higher body-esteem compared to those who experienced coercion or rape. The groups that faced coercion, attempted coercion, and rape did not differ in body-esteem levels, but those with attempted rape had higher body-esteem than the others. The findings suggest that body-esteem is negatively associated with certain types of sexual victimization, while escaping rape may lead to improved body-esteem. Overall, the research contributes valuable insights into the interplay between body-esteem and sexual victimization experiences."
