    "overall_theme": "The research investigates the impact of supply chain management on medical equipment manufacturers' responses to increased demand during epidemics, specifically focusing on data from the MERS epidemic in South Korea.",
    "detailed_summary": "This study addresses the challenges medical equipment manufacturers face in matching supply with heightened demand during epidemic events. By examining the effects of supply chain management on manufacturers' responses to epidemic-driven demand, the research utilizes novel data from South Korea collected around the MERS epidemic. The findings reveal that epidemics can significantly boost sales performance for manufacturers, with a recorded increase of 10.2 percentage points. The study identifies that expanding the supply base\u2014specifically the number of supply channels\u2014enables better responses to demand surges, thereby enhancing sales performance. Interestingly, it is noted that manufacturers with lower market status tend to expand their supply bases more than those with higher status. The research concludes with managerial insights aimed at helping manufacturers optimize their supply chains to improve performance during such critical demand periods."
