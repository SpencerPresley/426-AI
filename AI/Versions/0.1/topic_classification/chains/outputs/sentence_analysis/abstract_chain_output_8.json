    "detailed_summary": "This research paper explores the capacity of preschool children to engage in scientific practices and highlights the evolving role of teachers from knowledge transmitters to facilitators of inquiry-based learning. While existing studies have examined how preschoolers engage in scientific inquiry, there is a notable gap in understanding the necessary teacher strategies to foster meaningful engagement. The study reviews literature on preschool scientific inquiry, aiming to develop a comprehensive framework that provides teachers with actionable strategies to create a culture of inquiry throughout their programs. By analyzing 15 studies, the research identifies five major themes that emphasize the importance of children's curiosity and interests as foundational elements for inquiry. The proposed strategies are intended to be integrated rather than used in isolation, enabling teachers to transform both play and structured activities into rigorous educational experiences that cultivate a lasting culture of inquiry in the classroom."
