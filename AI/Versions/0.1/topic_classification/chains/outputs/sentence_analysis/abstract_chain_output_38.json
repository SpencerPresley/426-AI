    "overall_theme": "The abstract presents the Integrated Capacious Model of Leadership Identities Construction (ICM) as a comprehensive framework for understanding and developing leader identity by integrating existing theories and contextual factors.",
    "detailed_summary": "The research introduces the Integrated Capacious Model of Leadership Identities Construction (ICM), a framework that synthesizes four existing leader identity theories and contextual factors from the Capacious Model. The ICM's components include systems that contextualize leader identity over time and space, influences that identify key factors in leader identity construction, and theories that explain the identity formation process. The model responds to the demand for interdisciplinary frameworks in leader identity literature, proposing a broader view of leader identity that transcends individual instances. The integration of these elements results in a practical model that can be used to diagnose leader identity, design development programs, and identify research gaps in the field."
