    "detailed_summary": "This study focuses on the role of school leadership in providing effective intervention for students with dyslexia in kindergarten through second grade. It examines three leadership styles\u2014transformational, instructional, and integrated\u2014to understand their implications for dyslexia intervention. Despite effective leadership, a significant percentage of students struggle with reading, with 5-20% diagnosed with dyslexia, highlighting a critical gap. The research identifies that while phonetic and multisensory interventions are necessary for dyslexic students, many principals lack the requisite knowledge of these methods. The study's purpose is to explore factors influencing the level of appropriate intervention in schools. A questionnaire was distributed to K-2 principals across the United States, assessing their leadership skills, knowledge, and beliefs about dyslexia. The findings reveal that principals with a deeper understanding of dyslexia provide better services, regardless of their leadership style. The study concludes with eight recommendations for principals to enhance their support for students with dyslexia, based on the key finding that knowledge and beliefs are crucial for effective intervention."
