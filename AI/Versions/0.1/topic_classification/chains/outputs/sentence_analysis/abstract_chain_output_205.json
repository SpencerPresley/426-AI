    "overall_theme": "The research examines how international franchisors select governance modes when entering foreign markets, influenced by environmental uncertainties, market characteristics, and the franchisor's experience.",
    "detailed_summary": "This study empirically tests a theoretical model of governance modes used by international franchisors in foreign markets. Utilizing a unique dataset of 222 market expansions by US firms over seven years, it investigates the factors that influence franchisors' governance choices. The findings reveal that franchisors prefer modes with lower control in uncertain environments marked by corruption, economic downturns, and significant geographic distance. Additionally, both franchise system assets and local market resources impact these choices. The research emphasizes the need for firms to balance the costs of uncertainty with the protection of their capabilities, noting that this balance evolves with experience and market development. Furthermore, the study identifies new governance modes not previously documented and validates significant aspects of the Jell-Ojobor and Windsperger (2014) governance model using multiple theoretical perspectives."
