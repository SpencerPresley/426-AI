    "detailed_summary": "This research paper delves into the theoretical framework surrounding the concept of 'the contemporary' in the arts, specifically contrasting contemporary music with contemporary art. It argues that contemporary art has evolved from the avant-garde movements into a post-conceptual form that emphasizes discursive meaning and social processes. In contrast, contemporary music is depicted as struggling with its identity, remaining tied to aesthetic modernism and lacking conceptual depth. The paper also addresses sound art, highlighting its conflicts with the characteristics of contemporary art. The author posits that neither sound art nor contemporary music truly embodies the historical essence of 'contemporary' as defined in art theory, despite their claims. To address the limitations of existing categories, the author proposes the term 'musical contemporary art' to describe practices that significantly diverge from traditional contemporary music and sound art."
