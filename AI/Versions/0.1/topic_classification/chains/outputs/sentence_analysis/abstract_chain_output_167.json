    "detailed_summary": "This research paper explores the critical relationship between climate change and its effects on human environmental conditions and mortality. It highlights the alarming increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events attributed to human-induced climate change. The paper argues that these changes have immediate negative impacts on environmental sustainability and human life, as well as creating complex long-term risks. The authors focus on analyzing three levels of environmental impact risks related to climate change and human mortality. Additionally, they propose a conceptual framework for developing an empirical database that tracks human mortality events linked to climate change, alongside strategies aimed at enhancing global adaptation, resilience, and sustainability in the face of these challenges."
