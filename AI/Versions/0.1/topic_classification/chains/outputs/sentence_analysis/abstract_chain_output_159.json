    "detailed_summary": "This study addresses the growing concern of misinformation on the internet by examining how skepticism affects individuals' attitudes toward electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM). It specifically analyzes eWOM skepticism through three dimensions: suspicion of motivation, suspicion of truthfulness, and suspicion of identity. The research aims to determine which dimension is most influential and how these dimensions relate to each other. Additionally, it evaluates the impact of individual traits, such as dispositional trust and perceptions of structural assurance, on these skepticism dimensions and their overall effect on the credibility assessment of eWOM messages. Data were collected using an online scenario-based survey from 195 participants in the U.S., and analyzed using Partial Least Squares (PLS) and cluster analysis. Findings indicate that suspicion of identity significantly affects message credibility, and individuals with lower trust are more skeptical about motivations and truthfulness. Structural assurance was found to negatively influence all skepticism dimensions. The study highlights the need for enhanced protective measures on eWOM platforms and calls for stricter regulations against deceptive eWOM practices. Overall, the research contributes to the literature by validating the concept of eWOM skepticism as a formative construct and its impact on message credibility assessment."
