    "detailed_summary": "The research addresses diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which affects a significant portion of diabetic patients but lacks understanding of its molecular mechanisms and effective treatments. The authors introduce a novel zebrafish model to study acute DPN, where they induce beta-cell ablation and hyperglycemia using metronidazole. Their findings reveal unexpected structural changes in sensory and motor nerves, including abnormal neuron positioning, disrupted insulation, and altered myelination, all occurring without behavioral symptoms. This suggests that nerve changes may precede symptoms in hyperglycemic conditions. The study emphasizes the importance of this model for future research into the molecular underpinnings of DPN and potential therapeutic directions."
