    "detailed_summary": "This research paper examines how market-oriented reforms influence the incentives for firms to innovate, specifically analyzing the reforms implemented in Korea after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. The authors argue that an institution-based perspective is critical for understanding the factors that motivate firms to pursue innovation. They also integrate insights from competitive strategy literature to assess how these reforms, along with industry competition and firm-specific characteristics, impact investments in innovation. The findings reveal that while market reforms generally enhance both the inputs and outputs of innovation, the extent of this influence varies based on specific attributes of the firms involved."
