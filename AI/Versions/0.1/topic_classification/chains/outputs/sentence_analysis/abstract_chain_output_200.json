    "overall_theme": "The research investigates the differing goals of faculty and students in laboratory coursework, aiming to bridge the gap through a survey that captures student goals and achievement strategies.",
    "detailed_summary": "This research paper addresses the misalignment between faculty and student goals in laboratory courses, revealing that while faculty focus on developing critical thinking and learning techniques, students prioritize affective outcomes like finishing labs early and achieving good grades. Previous studies have thoroughly examined faculty goals but have mainly relied on qualitative methods for understanding student goals. To fill this gap, the researchers designed a brief online survey to collect data on student goals and their strategies for achieving them. The study presents findings from anonymous responses collected from undergraduate chemistry students at two Midwestern universities, discussing results at the beginning of the semester and after completing the lab portion of the course. Ultimately, the results aim to guide faculty in modifying laboratory curricula and instruction to better align with student objectives."
