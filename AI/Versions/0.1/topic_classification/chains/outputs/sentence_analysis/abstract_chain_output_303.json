            "reasoning": "The phrase 'top-down, enacted, institutional pushbacks' suggests a deliberate response from institutions, while 'supermobility and superdiversity' indicates the phenomena being resisted.

    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the institutional responses in academia to the phenomena of supermobility and superdiversity, employing frameworks from political economy and mobility geography. It focuses on the language used in job advertisements on a linguist forum, analyzing qualitative and quantitative data from various institutional contexts. The findings reveal that political populism and tightening job markets have led to an increase in temporary job labels, which are becoming the norm in a competitive academic landscape. The study also explores how euphemistic language is created to obscure the realities of temporary employment and how nationality criteria are used to justify exclusion from academic spaces. Ultimately, the paper challenges the notion of open borders for academics, showing that new linguistic trends reflect a growing sentiment against mobility and diversity in intellectual circles."
