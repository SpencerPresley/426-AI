    "detailed_summary": "This research focuses on the critical role of algebra in education and the lack of effective measures for assessing conceptual understanding. It investigates the technical adequacy of three procedural and two conceptual algebra screening measures across a large sample of 2,021 secondary students taught by 31 teachers in three states. A variety of assessments were administered, including teacher ratings, course grades, and state test scores, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of student performance. The study employed descriptive and correlation analyses to assess the reliability and validity of these measures. Results showed that procedural measures had high reliability and moderate validity, suggesting their potential as screening tools, while conceptual measures displayed lower validity and were deemed unsuitable for current use. Ultimately, the findings aim to inform the redesign of assessment tools to enhance their effectiveness in measuring mathematics proficiency among algebra students."
