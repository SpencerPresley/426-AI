    "detailed_summary": "This paper investigates the transformative changes in the field of economics, particularly during the 'credibility revolution,' which has reshaped the topics, formats, and publication venues for economists. Through an analysis of the 100 most cited papers from 1970 to 2019, the research reveals a move towards more empirical studies and standardized paper structures akin to scientific methodologies. Additionally, it notes a rise in female authorship, especially in emerging fields, reflecting progress in gender representation. A notable finding is the decreasing citation rates of papers from the traditionally prestigious 'Top 5' journals, suggesting that articles from other journals are becoming increasingly influential. Overall, the paper highlights significant shifts in research practices and publication dynamics within the discipline of economics."
