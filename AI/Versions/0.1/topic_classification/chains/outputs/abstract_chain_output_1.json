    "detailed_summary": "The paper aims to explore how deregulating foreign equity ownership affects a firm's investment in innovation. Using data from 530 Korean manufacturing firms between 1998 and 2003 and employing generalized estimating equations, the study finds an inverted U-shaped relationship between foreign ownership and R&D investment. Initially, foreign ownership increases R&D investment due to better managerial oversight, but this effect diminishes as foreign ownership becomes more concentrated. Additionally, the study considers firm heterogeneity, observing that older firms negatively moderate this relationship, while firms with growth opportunities positively moderate it."
