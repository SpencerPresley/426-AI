        "reasoning": "GnRH agonist treatment refers to the specific intervention applied to the subjects to study its effects on vaginal patency and behavior, making it a key methodological approach.",

        "reasoning": "Behavioral observation is the method used to assess changes in interaction and aggression towards males, which is essential for understanding the impact of the treatment.",
