        "reasoning": "Testing multimodal and unimodal stimuli represents the methodological approach used to assess the frogs' responses to different types of mating signals, which is crucial for understanding their mating behavior.",

        "reasoning": "Environmental manipulation involves altering physical conditions to observe their effects on animal behavior, which is a key methodological process in this study.",
