        "reasoning": "Sampling refers to the process of collecting data or specimens from a population, which in this case involves collecting insect samples to study their responses to temperature.",

        "reasoning": "Examining biomass is a method of analyzing the amount of living organisms in a given area, which is crucial for understanding the relationship between insect populations and temperature.",

        "reasoning": "Regional comparison involves analyzing differences in insect responses to temperature across various geographic locations, which is a methodological approach in this study.",
        "passages": [
            "We found strong regional differences in the phenology of insects and their response to temperature"
