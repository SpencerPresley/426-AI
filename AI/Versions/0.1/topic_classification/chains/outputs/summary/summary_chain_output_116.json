    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of customer incivility on employee service performance through an integrative framework based on self-determination theory. The study reveals that the negative effects of customer incivility on employee performance, mediated by intrinsic motivation, are influenced by employees' core self-evaluations. Specifically, employees with higher core self-evaluations are less negatively affected by customer incivility compared to those with lower evaluations, indicating that individual differences in self-perception play a crucial role in how employees respond to challenging customer interactions.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the main focus, which is the relationship between customer incivility and employee performance, as well as the mediating role of intrinsic motivation and the moderating effect of core self-evaluations. It avoids mentioning specific methodologies and instead focuses on the findings and implications of the research.",
