    "summary": "This paper examines the artistic practice of contemporary artist Cauleen Smith, focusing on her exploration of the aesthetic and political dimensions of cinematic space, place, and movement. It highlights how Smith's work embodies an 'aesthetics and politics of errantry,' which embraces unconventional forms of relationships and mobility. The research draws on critical theories from cultural geography and Black feminism, linking Smith's artistic expressions to broader themes of colonialism and its spatial dynamics. Ultimately, the paper presents Smith's cinematic approach as both a formal and technological endeavor, deeply rooted in a Black feminist understanding of place.",
