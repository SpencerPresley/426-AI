    "summary": "This research explores how the increasing human activity in primate habitats influences the perceptions of crab-eating bearded capuchins among residents and tourists in two economically distinct communities in Northeast Brazil. The study finds that while residents frequently encounter capuchins, those in the tourism-focused community (Preguicas) generally have a more favorable view than those in the crab-catching community (Parnaiba). Notably, both residents and tourists report minimal conflicts with these primates. Despite awareness of legal protections for capuchins, some residents still engage in feeding them, indicating a disconnect between knowledge and behavior. The findings suggest that resource overlap does not inherently lead to perceived conflict, and there are opportunities for tourism and conservation initiatives to foster sustainable coexistence between humans and capuchins.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the main findings regarding human perceptions of capuchins in two different economic contexts. It emphasizes the lack of conflict reported by both residents and tourists and notes the behavioral discrepancies related to feeding the capuchins. The conclusion regarding the potential for harmonious coexistence reflects the overall aim of the study, aligning with the abstract's focus on understanding human-animal interactions amidst changing habitats.",
