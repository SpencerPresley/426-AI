    "summary": "This research investigates how individual resilience can mitigate the adverse effects of role stressors, stress arousal, and burnout on job satisfaction and turnover intentions among auditors. The study, which involved surveying 332 auditors from nine public accounting firms, found that resilience is significantly associated with lower levels of stress and burnout, while also enhancing job satisfaction and reducing turnover intentions. Although the study's cross-sectional design limits causal interpretations, it suggests that resilience training programs could be beneficial in reducing burnout, thereby improving job satisfaction and decreasing turnover intentions in the public accounting sector.",
