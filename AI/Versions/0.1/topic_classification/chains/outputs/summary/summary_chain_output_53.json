    "summary": "This research investigates how resilience influences the relationship between academic burnout and psychological distress among undergraduate accounting students in the United States. It builds on previous studies, particularly those by Garcia-Izquierdo et al. (2018), which focused on Spanish nursing students. The study reveals that resilience negatively correlates with psychological distress and various dimensions of academic burnout, suggesting that higher resilience leads to lower burnout and distress. Additionally, the findings indicate that emotional exhaustion and academic inefficacy are positively associated with psychological distress. The research also explores two theoretical models, one where resilience acts as a predictor of burnout affecting distress, and another where distress influences burnout. Ultimately, the study emphasizes the role of resilience as a compensatory mechanism in mitigating the adverse effects of academic challenges on mental health.",
