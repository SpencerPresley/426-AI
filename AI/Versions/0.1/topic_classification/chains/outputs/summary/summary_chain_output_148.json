    "summary": "This research investigates the implications of mobile money (MM) usage on gambling behaviors, particularly among vulnerable populations in developing countries. While mobile money has been recognized for its socioeconomic benefits, this study reveals a concerning link between MM usage and increased gambling tendencies. The findings indicate that frequent use of mobile money is associated with a higher likelihood of gambling, especially among young male users who belong to lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The results highlight the need for policymakers to address the potential negative consequences of mobile money, particularly its role in promoting risky behaviors such as gambling among at-risk groups.",
