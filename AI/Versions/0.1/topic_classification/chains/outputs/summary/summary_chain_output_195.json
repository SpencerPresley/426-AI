    "summary": "This article addresses the critical yet overlooked intersection of ethics and diversity in the field of social work. It proposes 'intersectional ethics' as a new ethical framework aimed at enhancing ethical deliberation by utilizing a set of six heuristic questions. These questions are designed to facilitate a deeper understanding of various factors such as positionality, social identity, and moral theories, thereby promoting anti-oppressive ethics and encouraging critical reflection. The article also offers specific recommendations for integrating this framework into social work ethics education.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the abstract by highlighting the main focus on the intersection of ethics and diversity, the introduction of intersectional ethics as a framework, and the practical implications for social work education. This encapsulates the key themes without delving into the specific methodologies used, which aligns with the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
