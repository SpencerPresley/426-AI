    "summary": "This research introduces the concept of 'chronotopization,' which examines how perceptions of normative social behavior are influenced by the interplay of time, space, and social interactions, as evidenced by data from Iranian Azerbaijani migrants. The study argues that various 'chronotopes of normalcy' shape individuals' sociolinguistic behaviors and normative judgments. Additionally, it emphasizes that understanding these chronotopic and scalar perspectives can broaden theoretical frameworks in sociolinguistics, applicable to a range of phenomena beyond just language choice.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research, highlighting the introduction of 'chronotopization' as a key concept and its implications for understanding social behavior and language use. It reflects the dynamic nature of social norms as constructed through temporal and spatial contexts and emphasizes the broader applicability of these findings in sociolinguistic theory.",
