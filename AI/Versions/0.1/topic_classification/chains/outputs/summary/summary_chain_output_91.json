    "summary": "This research investigates the experiences of students regarding alienation and intimacy while writing in an English language arts classroom, framed through critical theories of labor and commodification. The study identifies how specific practices can foster intimacy in educational settings, particularly through collaborative knowledge building and flexible work arrangements. Findings suggest that the conditions of industrialization and commodification can either enhance feelings of alienation or intimacy among students, influenced by the teacher's efforts to deindustrialize the writing process. However, the reliance on grades and standardized assessments often exacerbates alienation, highlighting the tension between educational practices and industrial assessment systems. Ultimately, the research illustrates how teachers and students can counteract these industrial influences by engaging more intimately with texts and focusing on smaller-scale interactions.",
