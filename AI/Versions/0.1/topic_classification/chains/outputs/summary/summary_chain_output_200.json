    "summary": "This research addresses the differing goals between faculty and students in laboratory coursework. Faculty prioritize educational objectives such as critical thinking and learning techniques, while students focus on personal outcomes like finishing labs quickly and achieving good grades. Previous studies have extensively examined faculty goals but have mainly relied on qualitative methods to explore student goals. To bridge this gap, the researchers developed an online survey to collect data on students' goals and their strategies for achieving them. The study presents findings from undergraduate chemistry students at two Midwestern universities, discussing their goals and achievement strategies at the start and end of the laboratory course. The results aim to guide faculty in modifying laboratory curricula to better align with student objectives.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the main focus on the misalignment of goals between faculty and students, the methodologies employed to gather student data, and the intended impact of the findings on faculty practices. It avoids specific details about the methods used in the research, aligning with the requirement to focus on the main idea rather than the methodologies.",
