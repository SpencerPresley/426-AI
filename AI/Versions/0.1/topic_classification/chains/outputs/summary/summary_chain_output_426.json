    "summary": "This research highlights the need for further understanding of the experiences of parents who support pre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) children. It explores how these parents view their roles as advocates, revealing that most consider themselves advocates, primarily utilizing digital platforms. The motivations for their advocacy stem from parental concerns, although opinions vary on whether such advocacy positively affects their relationships with their children. A significant shared concern among parents is the right to privacy for their TGNC children. The findings suggest ways to engage and mobilize parents of TGNC youth in advocacy efforts.",
