    "summary": "This research addresses the challenges faced by medical equipment manufacturers in meeting the increased demand during epidemic events, specifically focusing on the MERS epidemic in South Korea. The study finds that epidemics can significantly enhance the sales performance of these manufacturers, with an observed increase of 10.2 percentage points. It further reveals that expanding the supply base, which involves increasing the number of supply channels, allows manufacturers to better respond to the heightened demand. Interestingly, manufacturers with lower market status tend to expand their supply bases more than those with higher market status. The findings provide valuable managerial insights on optimizing supply chain management to improve responsiveness and performance during epidemic-driven demand surges.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the main focus on how medical equipment manufacturers adapt their supply chains in response to epidemic-driven demand. It outlines the key findings, including the positive impact of epidemics on sales performance and the strategic importance of expanding supply channels. The mention of market status differences among manufacturers adds depth to the insights provided. Overall, the reasoning behind the summary is grounded in the main themes and findings presented in the abstract, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the research without delving into specific methodologies.",
