    "summary": "This research investigates the constraints imposed on the three-nucleon force (3NF) within the context of chiral effective field theory (xEFT) by analyzing bound-state observables in systems with three and four nucleons. The study highlights the necessity of incorporating various uncertainties, including experimental errors and theoretical truncation errors, to achieve consistent results for key nuclear properties such as binding energies and decay rates. Importantly, it identifies the I3-decay rate as a critical observable that provides unique constraints on the low-energy constants of the 3NF, which are essential for accurate parameter estimation. The findings report a specific value for the xEFT expansion parameter, indicating significant insights into the behavior of few-nucleon systems.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is to understand the constraints on the three-nucleon force using theoretical and experimental frameworks. It emphasizes the importance of addressing uncertainties and highlights the significance of the I3-decay rate in parameter estimation, all of which are central themes in the abstract. The mention of the xEFT expansion parameter adds a quantitative aspect that reflects the research's findings.",
