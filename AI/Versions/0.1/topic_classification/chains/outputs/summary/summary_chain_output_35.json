    "summary": "This research examines how yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys navigate the balance between foraging for food and avoiding predators in environments with varying levels of hunting pressure. The study highlights that in habitats where hunting risk is high, the monkeys prioritize predator avoidance over food searching. The findings indicate that both perceived and actual predation risks significantly influence the monkeys' habitat use, while food availability, particularly fruit biomass, plays a lesser role. Ultimately, the study confirms that in high hunting pressure areas, the risks associated with predation are more critical in shaping the monkeys' spatial behaviors than the availability of food resources.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the primary behavioral trade-off faced by the capuchin monkeys, which is the balance between food searching and predator avoidance. It emphasizes the main findings regarding the influence of predation risk on habitat use and contrasts this with the relatively minor role of food availability. This aligns with the overall theme presented in the abstract, which discusses the impact of hunting pressure on the monkeys' behavior.",
