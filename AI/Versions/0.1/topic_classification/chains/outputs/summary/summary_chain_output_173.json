    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) program on poverty rates in rural Costa Rica from 2007 to 2009. It finds that although the program did not reduce national poverty rates, it led to increased poverty in specific areas where it significantly affected deforestation. This adverse effect was particularly notable among uneducated males engaged in agriculture. The study concludes that the relationship between ecosystem service provision and poverty is complex and suggests that targeted interventions could mitigate negative impacts on the most affected groups.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is the examination of the PES program's effects on poverty rates, highlighting both the overall findings and specific demographic impacts. It emphasizes the nuanced outcomes of the program, including the unexpected rise in poverty in certain areas, and suggests potential policy implications. This reasoning is grounded in the abstract's content, which outlines the research's objectives, findings, and conclusions without delving into the specific methodologies employed.",
