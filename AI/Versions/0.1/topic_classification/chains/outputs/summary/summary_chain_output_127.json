    "summary": "This study investigates the stereotype contents held by Vietnamese high school and college students towards Americans and Black/African-Americans, while also evaluating the effectiveness of three theoretical models in predicting these stereotypes. The findings reveal that the students generally hold positive stereotypes about Americans, but have a mix of positive and negative views towards Black/African-Americans. Among the theoretical models tested, the communication model was found to be the most effective predictor of these stereotypes, followed by the psychological model, with the contact model being the least effective. The study discusses both theoretical insights and practical implications derived from these findings.",
