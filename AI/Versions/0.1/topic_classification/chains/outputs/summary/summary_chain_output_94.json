    "summary": "This research investigates how employees' emotional well-being mediates the relationship between relationship conflict and counterproductive work behavior (CWB). It distinguishes between CWB directed towards the organization and CWB directed towards individuals. The findings indicate that emotional well-being serves as a mediator for the relationship between conflict and negative behaviors towards the organization, particularly for employees with high emotional intelligence. However, this mediating effect does not apply to negative behaviors directed at individuals, highlighting the nuanced role of emotional intelligence in workplace dynamics.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core focus of the research, which is the role of emotional well-being in mediating the effects of relationship conflict on workplace behaviors. It emphasizes the differentiation between types of counterproductive behaviors and the significance of emotional intelligence, which are central themes in the abstract. The explanation avoids specific methodologies, maintaining a focus on the findings and implications of the research.",
