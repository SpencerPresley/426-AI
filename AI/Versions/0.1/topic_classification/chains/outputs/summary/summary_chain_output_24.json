    "summary": "This study addresses the high mortality rates among African Americans due to complications from uncontrolled hypertension. It investigates whether a faith-based self-management education program can enhance self-care practices related to hypertension management in this demographic. The research involved ten African American adults with a hypertension diagnosis of at least six months who participated in an eight-week program designed to teach management strategies. The program uniquely integrated spiritual practices such as prayer, Scripture reading, and journaling to support participants in managing their health effectively.",
