    "summary": "This research explores the experiences of multilingual students who are not classified as English language learners (ELLs) in English language arts (ELA) classrooms. It focuses on a group of multilingual girls taught by a monolingual white teacher, investigating how the implementation of translanguaging practices allows these students to challenge the traditional English-only norms in their classroom. The findings reveal that multilingualism is predominantly utilized in spoken interactions, particularly during small-group discussions, where students engage collaboratively in writing tasks while expressing their emotions. The study advocates for a broader analytical perspective that recognizes the strengths of multilingual students in predominantly English-speaking environments and promotes inclusive teaching practices that can disrupt monolingual dominance in ELA classrooms.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research, highlighting the focus on multilingual students and their experiences in ELA classrooms. It emphasizes the significance of translanguaging practices and how they empower students to challenge monolingual norms. The summary also reflects the findings regarding language use in different contexts and the call for inclusive teaching approaches, which are crucial elements of the research.",
    "feedback": {
        "methodologies_feedback": "The methodologies identified were appropriate and relevant to the abstract. However, it would be beneficial to include more context about how these methodologies specifically contribute to understanding the experiences of multilingual students. This could help in clarifying their significance in relation to the research findings.",
        "abstract_sentence_analysis_feedback": "The sentence-level analysis was thorough and provided a clear understanding of the abstract's content. However, some sentences could be more concisely interpreted to enhance clarity. For example, simplifying complex sentences could make it easier to extract the main ideas. Overall, the analysis is strong, but a focus on conciseness could improve the readability of the findings."
