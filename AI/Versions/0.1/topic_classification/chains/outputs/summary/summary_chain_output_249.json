    "summary": "This research article proposes a novel analytical framework known as the chronotopic-scalar system to study language use, particularly in multilingual contexts. It draws on data from Iranian Azerbaijanis to illustrate how individuals' access to linguistic resources is influenced by their historical experiences related to time and space. The author emphasizes that socialization shapes the mental frameworks individuals develop regarding language, impacting their language use in specific contexts. The article further argues for the importance of understanding the spatial and temporal dimensions of language resources to address ongoing debates about the authenticity of languages and the nature of multilingual practices. By decentralizing the concept of language and focusing on contextual factors, the study aims to provide deeper insights into how individuals utilize language and form ideologies about it, challenging traditional views of languages as fixed systems.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the introduction of the chronotopic-scalar system, the influence of historical and social factors on language perception and utilization, and the implications for understanding multilingual practices. It reflects the main arguments made in the abstract while avoiding specific methodological details, thereby aligning with the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
    "feedback": {
        "methodologies_feedback": "The methodologies identified provide a good overview of the analytical frameworks discussed in the abstract. However, it would be beneficial to clarify the distinctions between these frameworks and their specific applications in the research context. This could help in better understanding the implications of the methodologies for the findings presented. Additionally, ensuring that the descriptions of the methodologies focus on their practical implications rather than theoretical definitions could enhance the clarity of the analysis.",
        "abstract_sentence_analysis_feedback": "The sentence-level analysis is detailed and effectively captures the meanings and reasoning behind each sentence. However, it could be improved by providing a more cohesive connection between the individual sentence meanings and the overall theme of the abstract. Highlighting how each sentence contributes to the overarching argument would strengthen the analysis. Additionally, ensuring that the confidence scores reflect the nuances of the language used in the abstract could provide a more accurate representation of the certainty in interpretations."
