    "summary": "This research explores how companies strategically integrate alliances and acquisitions within an exploration/exploitation framework. By analyzing a dataset of 1270 acquisitions from 836 firms, the study identifies five distinct patterns of behavior regarding alliances and acquisitions. The analysis reveals that certain patterns (III and IV) strongly intertwine exploration and exploitation strategies, while other patterns (I, II, and V) show a more exploitative focus with weaker connections between the two strategies. This work contributes to understanding the strategic choices firms make in balancing innovation with the utilization of existing resources.",
