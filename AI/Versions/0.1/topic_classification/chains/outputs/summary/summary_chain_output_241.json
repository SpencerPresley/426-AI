    "summary": "This study investigates the construction of literacy sponsorship in a rural region of the United States, focusing on the perspectives of teachers and students. The findings reveal that schools and teachers are primarily recognized as literacy sponsors, while the contributions of parents and local literacies are largely overlooked. Key aspects identified include the significance of interpersonal relationships and the reliance on standardized curricula that lack local relevance. The research highlights a tendency among educators to prioritize established educational norms over local resources, which may inhibit critical literacy perspectives. The study concludes with a call for literacy educators to consider rural learners as central to their work, advocating for a more inclusive approach in educational policies and research.",
