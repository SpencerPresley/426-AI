    "summary": "The paper discusses the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2), which aims to create a detailed chemodynamical map of the Milky Way. It highlights the complexity and evolution of the targeting strategy for the survey, presenting updates and enhancements to the initial strategy as outlined in a previous study. The modifications include the introduction of 'Ancillary Science Programs' and a 1.5-year survey extension called the Bright Time Extension (BTX), both aimed at expanding the research scope and improving efficiency. The paper details 23 distinct ancillary programs, their scientific aims, and target selection methods, while reflecting on nearly a decade of operational experience from both APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2. Additionally, it mentions a companion paper that provides related insights for the Southern Hemisphere operations of APOGEE-2.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the main objectives of the APOGEE-2 survey, the evolution of its targeting strategy, and the specific updates introduced. It avoids mentioning specific methodologies, instead emphasizing the overall goals and developments of the project. The reasoning is based on the clear articulation of the survey's aims and the significance of the updates presented in the paper, which were derived from the abstract's description.",
