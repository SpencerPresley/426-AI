    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of agricultural and urban development on nutrient loading in streams and the potential of wetland creation to mitigate this issue. By comparing a newly created wetland with an established one along the St. Martin River, the study evaluates their effectiveness in promoting bacterial denitrification, a process that can reduce excess nutrients. The findings indicate that although denitrification rates varied, they were similar between the two wetlands, with significant increases in potential rates following nitrate amendments. The created wetland demonstrated a more abundant denitrifying community, suggesting its capability to effectively remove excess nutrients and function similarly to the established wetland.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, emphasizing the relationship between human activities and nutrient loading, the role of wetlands in addressing this issue, and the comparative analysis of the two wetland systems. It highlights the main findings regarding denitrification rates and community composition without delving into specific methodologies, adhering to the requirement to focus on the research's main idea.",
