    "summary": "This research investigates the experiences of parents of pre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) children, specifically focusing on their decision-making processes regarding the disclosure of their children's TGNC identities to extended family members. The study highlights a significant gap in existing literature concerning these parental experiences. It identifies two main disclosure strategies: casual unfolding disclosure, where parents let family members observe their child's identity development, and explicit direct disclosure through written communication. The findings reveal that parents often avoid disclosing their child's identity to certain family members based on factors such as geographical distance, age, and the conservative or religious beliefs of those family members. The impact of disclosure on familial relationships is complex, with some relationships strengthening while others become strained or dissolve. Ultimately, the research underscores the dual role of extended family as both potential supporters and sources of stress, and it emphasizes the strategies parents use to navigate these dynamics. The implications of this study extend to social work practice and policy, highlighting the need for supportive frameworks for families with TGNC children.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by outlining the main focus on parental decision-making regarding disclosure of TGNC identities. It emphasizes the identified strategies for disclosure, the factors influencing these decisions, and the varied impacts on family relationships. Additionally, it addresses the implications for social work, thereby reflecting the comprehensive nature of the findings. This reasoning is supported by the detailed analysis of the abstract, which outlines the study's phases, methodology, and key findings without delving into specific methods used in the research.",
