    "summary": "This research investigates how organizations are evolving into agile enterprises by utilizing digital technologies. It highlights the importance of organizational mindfulness in managing digital transformation and reducing rigidity associated with technology use. Despite the recognition of organizational mindfulness's significance, its specific influence on digital transformation and the development of information processing capacity (IPC) has not been thoroughly studied. The authors conceptualize IPC within the framework of the information processing view and explore the connections between organizational mindfulness, IPC, and market agility. Findings indicate that organizations that embrace mindfulness during their digital transformation efforts are better positioned to establish a solid technological infrastructure, foster effective internal and external relationships, and align their business strategies with technology initiatives, thereby improving their responsiveness to market changes.",
