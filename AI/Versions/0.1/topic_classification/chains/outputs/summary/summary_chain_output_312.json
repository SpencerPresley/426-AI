    "summary": "The research focuses on the introduction and spread of the mourning gecko (Lepidodactylus lugubris) in the Caribbean, emphasizing the role of citizen science in tracking non-native species. New observations of this gecko on Paradise Island in The Bahamas and Grand Cayman highlight its significant spread since its first recorded sighting a decade ago. The study underscores the importance of public participation in documenting the distribution of non-native reptiles and raises concerns about the potential ecological impacts on native species due to the gecko's ability to inhabit natural environments.",
    "reasoning": "This summary captures the central theme of the research, which is the tracking of non-native reptiles, specifically the mourning gecko, and the involvement of citizen science in this process. It discusses the new observations made in the Caribbean, the implications of these findings on understanding the species' spread, and the potential ecological consequences, without delving into specific methodologies used in the research.",
