    "summary": "The research investigates the effectiveness of various identification methods for human remains used by forensic pathologists, particularly focusing on the limitations of DNA analysis due to its high cost and time requirements. It highlights the increasing adoption of CT imaging in forensic settings as a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods. The study collected and analyzed 20 cases of human remains using both antemortem and postmortem CT images, demonstrating that even forensic pathologists with limited experience in CT imaging can successfully identify remains through visual comparison.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main idea of the research by emphasizing the focus on human remains identification methods, particularly the challenges posed by DNA analysis and the advantages of CT imaging. It reflects the study's aim to broaden the identification capabilities of forensic pathologists and showcases the successful results achieved through the collected case studies. This reasoning is supported by the abstract's emphasis on cost-effectiveness, the introduction of CT imaging, and the successful identification outcomes.",
