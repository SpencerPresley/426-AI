    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of humor styles on the mental and physical health of parents caring for children with developmental disabilities, who typically face higher stress and poorer health outcomes compared to parents of typically developing children. The study explores how adaptive humor styles, such as self-enhancing and affiliative humor, relate to better mental health outcomes, with social support acting as a significant mediator in these relationships. Conversely, self-defeating humor is linked to negative health outcomes, also mediated by social support. The findings suggest that adaptive humor can help caregivers obtain support and manage stress, ultimately enhancing their resilience.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, which is the relationship between humor styles and health outcomes among parents of children with developmental disabilities. It highlights the key findings regarding the positive effects of adaptive humor and the negative implications of maladaptive humor, as well as the mediating role of social support. This aligns with the overall theme and objectives outlined in the abstract, providing a clear overview without delving into specific methodologies.",
