    "summary": "This research investigates the protective role of mangroves against economic damages caused by cyclones in coastal communities. It highlights that areas suffering from mangrove deforestation are increasingly at risk of economic losses during cyclone events. Previous assessments of mangrove benefits were limited to individual case studies, lacking a broader perspective. The study analyzes the impact of cyclones on economic activity in nearly 2,000 tropical and subtropical communities across 23 countries from 2000 to 2012. The findings reveal that communities with average mangrove coverage face significant economic losses, suggesting that restoring mangroves could be a more cost-effective strategy for protection against cyclones, and that the negative impacts of mangrove loss are more severe than previously estimated.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main focus of the research, emphasizing the importance of mangroves in mitigating economic damages from cyclones. It outlines the context of the study, the gap in previous research, the scope of the analysis, and the significant findings, without delving into the specific methodologies used.",
