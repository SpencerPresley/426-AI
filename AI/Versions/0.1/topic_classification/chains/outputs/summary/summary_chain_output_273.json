    "summary": "This study explores the connection between investors' familiarity biases\u2014specifically home bias and endowment bias\u2014and various factors related to their financial situations, expectations, and personal characteristics. The findings reveal that certain demographics, such as higher income, more education, male gender, non-white ethnicity, and greater risk tolerance, are associated with a higher risk of endowment bias. Additionally, a profile of investors likely to exhibit home bias is identified, characterized by lower financial sophistication, lower net worth, older age, female gender, higher risk aversion, positive outlook on the domestic economy, and shorter investment horizons. The research is significant as it utilizes directly reported stock holdings from U.S. investors to examine individual traits correlated with familiarity bias, providing valuable insights for financial professionals on how to tailor educational efforts for diverse clients.",
