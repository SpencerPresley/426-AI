    "summary": "This study investigates the immediate effects of music on stress reduction by comparing music listening and musical improvisation. It aims to contribute to existing literature, which primarily focuses on long-term outcomes, by examining the effects in a single session. The research involved 105 participants who completed a stress-inducing task and were then assigned to one of three recovery conditions: control, music listening, or musical improvisation. The findings indicate that while participants generally reported improved mood, significant physiological stress reduction was observed in the music listening condition compared to the control and improvisation groups.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research, highlighting the comparison of music listening and improvisation in reducing stress, the focus on immediate effects, and the overall findings regarding mood and physiological responses. It avoids delving into specific methodologies, which aligns with the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
