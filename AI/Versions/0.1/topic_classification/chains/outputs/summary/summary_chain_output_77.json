    "summary": "This research investigates how the design of right-slanted fonts can significantly enhance the effectiveness of promotional advertisements by influencing consumer behavior. The study posits that such fonts, which suggest forward movement, can increase consumer engagement with promotions, leading to higher intentions to visit stores and make purchases. The findings reveal that these fonts evoke a sense of urgency and dynamic mental imagery, particularly affecting deal-prone consumers who may regret missing out on offers. However, the impact of right-slanted fonts is contingent upon the presence of a promotional offer in the advertisement, highlighting their role in enhancing consumer response to marketing communications.",
