    "summary": "This research paper investigates how consumer investment in financial literacy influences the likelihood of seeking advice from financial planners. It challenges the traditional view of financial literacy as a fixed trait and proposes that it can be shaped by individual investment. The authors suggest that investment in financial literacy and seeking financial advice can act as substitutes, meaning that as individuals become more financially literate, they may be less inclined to seek professional advice. The study uses data from the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances to test this hypothesis and finds a significant negative correlation between financial literacy investment and the probability of consulting a financial planner. The findings indicate that existing models may not adequately explain this relationship, but the authors argue that their approach of treating financial literacy as a variable influenced by consumer behavior provides a clearer understanding.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main objective of the research, which is to explore the relationship between financial literacy investment and the need for financial advice. It emphasizes the novel approach of viewing financial literacy as a variable rather than a constant, and it highlights the significant findings derived from the data analysis. The reasoning is based on the abstract's focus on the implications of these findings and the proposed model, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the research without delving into specific methodologies.",
