    "summary": "This research investigates the automobile consumption credit system in China, emphasizing its significance in supporting the automobile industry while highlighting the need for improvements in the existing credit framework. The study identifies the risks associated with loan defaults, which negatively impact company profits. It reveals that macro-level economic factors are linked to lower rates of responsible borrowing behavior, while personal-level factors tend to encourage better borrowing practices. Furthermore, the findings suggest a complex relationship between profit and commission structures, indicating that excessively high commissions can reduce profitability. The paper concludes with actionable recommendations based on these insights.",
