    "summary": "This research investigates how the actual expertise and social status of team members influence their perceived expertise and, consequently, their impact on team dynamics. It identifies the conditions under which teams prioritize perceived expertise over social status in determining influence relationships. A contingency model is proposed to illustrate how the relevance of these factors varies with different types of intragroup conflicts. The findings reveal that while social status initially drives perceived expertise, actual expertise becomes more significant as projects progress. Moreover, members perceived as experts are more influential during high task conflict or low relationship conflict situations. The study concludes with a discussion on the implications of these findings for both research and practical applications in team settings.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, which is the relationship between team members' expertise and social status and their influence within teams. It highlights the development of a contingency model, the findings about the dynamics of perceived expertise over time, and the conditions affecting influence, all without delving into the specific methodologies used. This approach ensures that the essence of the research is communicated effectively while adhering to the requirement of not discussing the methods in detail.",
