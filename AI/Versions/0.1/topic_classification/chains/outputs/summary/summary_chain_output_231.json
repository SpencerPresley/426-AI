    "summary": "This research investigates the relationship between sexual victimization acknowledgment and empathy towards rape victims among college students. It highlights that sexual victimization is a significant health issue for this demographic and that empathy may play a crucial role in addressing it. The study found that students who acknowledged their victimization exhibited higher levels of empathy compared to those who did not acknowledge their experiences, with notable gender differences in acknowledgment rates and empathy levels. Male victims were less likely to acknowledge their victimization than female victims. The findings suggest that understanding the dynamics of acknowledgment and empathy can inform prevention and support strategies for sexual victimization, particularly emphasizing the need to consider male victims who may be overlooked in such efforts.",
