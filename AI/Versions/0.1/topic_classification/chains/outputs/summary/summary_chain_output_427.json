    "summary": "This research investigates the factors influencing states' decisions to alter the sales factor weights in corporate income tax (CIT) apportionment formulas. It highlights the political and economic influences that dictate when and why states manipulate these weights. The study finds a significant correlation between higher CIT rates and quicker adjustments to higher sales factor weights, suggesting that states may prefer this strategy for economic development rather than broadly reducing CIT rates. Additionally, the results indicate that growth in the CIT base and non-corporate tax revenues accelerates these adjustments, while political factors such as Democratic control and gubernatorial election years also play a crucial role in the timing of these changes.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main themes of the research, which include the examination of political and economic factors affecting tax policy changes, the relationship between CIT rates and sales factor weights, and the influence of economic growth and political control on these decisions. It does not delve into the specific methodologies used, focusing instead on the findings and implications of the research.",
