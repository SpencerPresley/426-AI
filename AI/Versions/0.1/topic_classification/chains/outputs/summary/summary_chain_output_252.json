    "summary": "This research emphasizes the significance of incorporating the study of religious behavior in psychology, particularly given its importance in American society and the increasing focus on diversity. The study investigates the availability of psychology of religion courses within undergraduate programs and evaluates the knowledge gained by students in these courses. Findings indicate that, unlike graduate programs, there has been no increase in the number of psychology of religion courses offered at the undergraduate level. However, students who enrolled in these courses demonstrated a significant improvement in their scientific understanding of psychology of religion compared to those who took other psychology courses. The study concludes by advocating for the expansion of psychology of religion course offerings for undergraduate students to enhance their educational experience.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by outlining the importance of studying religious behavior in psychology, the lack of growth in undergraduate course offerings, and the positive impact of these courses on students' knowledge. It avoids detailing specific methodologies and focuses on the implications and findings of the study, which aligns with the main idea presented in the abstract.",
