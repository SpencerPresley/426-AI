    "summary": "This research investigates the relationship between instructors' teaching knowledge and the effectiveness of active-learning strategies employed in large courses. It posits that variations in teaching knowledge may account for differences in how effectively instructors implement active learning, particularly distinguishing between generative instruction, which emphasizes student understanding, and active instruction, which focuses on activities and recall. The study reveals that instructors engaging in generative instruction utilize distinct pedagogical knowledge, which helps them design lessons that promote student reasoning and address difficulties. Ultimately, the research generates hypotheses regarding the essential teaching knowledge required for effective generative active-learning instruction.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the main focus on the link between teaching knowledge and active-learning effectiveness. It emphasizes the distinction between generative and activity-focused instruction, which is central to the findings. The summary avoids specific methodologies and instead presents the overarching themes and implications of the research, aligning with the requirements.",
