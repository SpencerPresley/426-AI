    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of a spouse's health shock on the labor supply of the other partner within aging households. It emphasizes the immediate and long-term adjustments in labor supply, revealing that while both partners show minimal changes in the short term, long-term adjustments vary significantly. Specifically, a husband's labor supply is influenced by his wife's health status, whereas a wife's work hours remain unaffected by her husband's health issues. The findings suggest that households with an ill wife may face greater challenges over time, likely due to traditional gender roles within the household.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, which is the effect of a spouse's health on labor supply adjustments in aging households. It highlights the distinction between short-term and long-term responses and emphasizes the gender dynamics at play, particularly the greater risk faced by households with an ill wife. This encapsulates the main findings without delving into the specific methodologies used, aligning with the requirement to focus on the research's main idea.",
