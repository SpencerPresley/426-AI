    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of the draft allocation system in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) on team performance, particularly focusing on the phenomenon of 'tanking,' where teams intentionally lose games to secure better draft picks. The study analyzes data from the 2000-2019 seasons and finds that teams are more likely to lose after being eliminated from playoff contention, a trend that is consistent across different coaching staff genders. Furthermore, the findings reveal an increase in tanking behavior following a 2015 change in the draft lottery rules, which was intended to mitigate such practices. Overall, the results suggest that the WNBA's draft system may inadvertently incentivize teams to lose, raising concerns about the competitive integrity of the league.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core focus of the research, which is the relationship between the WNBA's draft system and the occurrence of tanking. It highlights the key findings regarding team performance post-elimination and the effects of the 2015 draft lottery change. The reasoning behind the summary is grounded in the abstract's emphasis on the implications of the draft system on team behavior and the integrity of the league, while avoiding specific mentions of methodologies used in the study.",
