    "summary": "The research investigates the factors influencing empathy towards rape victims, focusing on whether participants know a rape victim, their own experiences with sexual victimization, and their gender. The study finds that individuals who know a rape victim demonstrate higher levels of empathy, particularly noting that women with personal experiences of sexual victimization report greater empathy compared to men and nonvictims. The results suggest that personal connections to rape victims enhance understanding of their experiences, indicating a need for further research into how these factors affect empathy, especially among men and nonvictims.",
