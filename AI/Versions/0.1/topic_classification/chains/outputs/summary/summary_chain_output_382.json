    "summary": "The research highlights the urgent need for innovative leadership skills to effectively address critical environmental challenges, which are often neglected in conventional academic settings. It introduces a collective leadership model that encompasses six key dimensions: Inquire, Connect, Engage, Strategize, Empower, and Reflect. The authors demonstrate how these dimensions can lead to meaningful and sustainable changes within communities and ecosystems through various illustrative case studies. Furthermore, the paper offers guidance for academic researchers on integrating these leadership dimensions into their work and provides additional online resources to facilitate the model's application in educational contexts.",
