    "summary": "This study investigates the impact of background noise on the acoustic communication and mate choice behavior of the tungara frog. It highlights how natural soundscapes, which consist of various animal calls, can affect communication effectiveness among frogs. The findings reveal that while female frogs have clear preferences for certain calls in low to moderate noise conditions, these preferences diminish in high noise environments. The research underscores the ecological implications of soundscape variation, particularly in breeding ponds where high noise levels can hinder female decision-making during mate selection.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research, focusing on how background noise influences communication and mate choice in tungara frogs. It synthesizes the key findings regarding female preferences under different noise conditions without detailing the specific methodologies used in the study, thus aligning with the requirement to avoid methodological focus.",
