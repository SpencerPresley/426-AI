    "summary": "This research highlights the significance of female bird songs, particularly in eastern bluebirds, and their role in communication between mates. The study reveals that these songs can vary based on context and may serve to indicate individual identity through their acoustic structure. The findings suggest that while the structure of these songs remains consistent over distance, notable differences exist between neighboring females in terms of song characteristics. The research underscores the need for further exploration of female songs and their functional adaptability.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is the investigation of female bird songs, their communicative functions, and the implications of their acoustic characteristics. It emphasizes the key findings regarding individual identity and the need for additional research, aligning with the overall theme presented in the abstract.",
