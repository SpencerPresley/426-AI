    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), a chemical found in many consumer products, on obesity-related outcomes in offspring when administered during pregnancy. The study finds that male offspring exposed to DOSS during development show significant increases in body weight and fat, alongside metabolic disorders such as glucose intolerance and elevated inflammatory markers. These findings suggest that exposure to DOSS may contribute to long-term obesity-related health issues in children, raising concerns about the safety of products containing this chemical during pregnancy.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core findings of the research, focusing on the relationship between DOSS exposure during pregnancy and its effects on offspring health, particularly regarding obesity and metabolic disorders. It highlights the significance of the findings and their implications for public health without delving into the specific methodologies used in the study, which aligns with the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
