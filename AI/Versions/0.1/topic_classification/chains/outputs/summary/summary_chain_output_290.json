    "summary": "The research focuses on deriving a mathematical formula that identifies the minimum positive integer related to the quantum product of two Schubert classes within the framework of submaximal isotropic Grassmannians, specifically in types B and C. The authors investigate this by examining curve neighborhoods and employ various combinatorial models to compute these neighborhoods, including k-strict partitions and partitions that align with the Bruhat order.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the aim of deriving a formula and the mathematical context in which this is done. It emphasizes the significance of the quantum product of Schubert classes and the specific mathematical structures (Grassmannians, curve neighborhoods, and combinatorial models) without detailing the methodologies used, thus adhering to the requirement of focusing on the main idea rather than the methods.",
