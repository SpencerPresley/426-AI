    "summary": "The abstract discusses the conservation status of the Northern Long-eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis), which was designated as federally threatened in the United States in 2016 due to significant population declines attributed to white-nose syndrome (WNS). It highlights the importance of new sightings of this species outside its known range, particularly in light of its dramatic decline. The paper reports the first capture and genetic confirmation of an adult male Northern Long-eared Bat on the Delmarva Peninsula, Maryland, indicating a potential expansion of its habitat. The authors call for further surveys along the Atlantic Coastal Plain to assess whether this area is increasingly being used by the species during the ongoing impacts of WNS.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research, focusing on the conservation status of the Northern Long-eared Bat and the significance of the new findings regarding its distribution. It emphasizes the urgency of the situation due to population declines and the need for further investigation in light of the species' challenges. The summary avoids specific mention of methodologies used, aligning with the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
