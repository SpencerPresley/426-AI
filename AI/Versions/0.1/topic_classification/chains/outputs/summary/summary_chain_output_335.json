    "summary": "The research addresses the crucial role of advocacy in nursing and the challenges nurses face in effectively advocating for patient safety and care quality. A toolkit was developed to enhance advocacy skills among nursing students, incorporating web-based learning and simulation experiences. Feedback from students was utilized to refine this toolkit, which was evaluated over four semesters with 131 participants. The results indicated that a significant majority of students felt the toolkit improved their understanding and practical application of advocacy skills, critical thinking, and overall preparedness for real-world nursing challenges. The findings suggest that such educational interventions are essential for bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application in nursing practice.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the primary objective of the research, which is to enhance advocacy skills in nursing students through a structured educational toolkit. It emphasizes the significance of the problem (nurses' hesitance to advocate), the development and evaluation of the toolkit, and the positive outcomes reported by students. This holistic view captures the essence of the research without delving into the specific methodologies used, aligning with the requirement to focus on the main idea rather than the methods.",
