    "summary": "The research investigates the significant presence of over 44.7 million immigrants in the United States as of 2018 and emphasizes the importance of understanding U.S. citizens' attitudes towards these immigrants due to their influence on immigration policy and treatment. The study employs a national identity framework, which includes elements like nativism and emotionality, to analyze these attitudes. It utilizes historical survey data from the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) across three different years\u20141995, 2003, and 2013\u2014to explore how perceptions of national identity relate to attitudes towards immigrants. The findings indicate a meaningful correlation between these perceptions and attitudes, suggesting that national identity significantly shapes public opinion on immigration.",
