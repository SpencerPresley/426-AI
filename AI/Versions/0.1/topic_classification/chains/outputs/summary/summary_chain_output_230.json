    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of climate change on precipitation patterns in El Yunque National Forest, Puerto Rico. It emphasizes the sensitivity of local ecosystems to hydroclimate changes and the necessity for fine-scale analysis due to predictions of reduced rainfall in the Caribbean. The study employs advanced modeling techniques to project future rainfall variability during the early rainfall season. Findings indicate a significant increase in dry-day frequency by mid-century, attributed to changes in atmospheric conditions, while also suggesting a potential recovery towards historical averages by the end of the century.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, which is on the effects of climate change on precipitation patterns in a specific ecological context. It highlights the importance of local-scale analysis in understanding the implications of broader climate models. The mention of significant findings regarding dry-day frequency and the potential for recovery provides a concise overview of the research outcomes without delving into specific methodologies.",
