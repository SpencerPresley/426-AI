    "summary": "This research paper evaluates the effectiveness of an oral hygiene promoting program (OHPP) utilizing a smartphone endomicroscope among elementary school students in Bangkok, Thailand. The study involved a quasi-experimental design with a sample of 59 fifth graders, divided into an experimental group that participated in the OHPP and a control group that received standard oral health education. The findings revealed that the experimental group demonstrated significantly improved oral health behaviors, particularly in terms of knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) related to oral hygiene, compared to the control group. However, no significant differences were observed regarding tongue cleanliness. The study highlights the role of the OHPP in empowering students to maintain their oral hygiene effectively.",
