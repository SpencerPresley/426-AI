    "summary": "This research paper explores the impact of market-oriented reforms on the innovation incentives of firms, particularly in the context of the reforms implemented in Korea after the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. It emphasizes the necessity of an institution-based perspective for understanding the factors that drive firms to innovate. The study also integrates insights from competitive strategy literature to analyze how these reforms, in conjunction with industry competition and specific firm characteristics, influence investments in innovation. The findings indicate that while market reforms generally enhance both the input and output of innovation, the extent of this effect is dependent on the unique attributes of the firms involved.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, which is the relationship between market-oriented reforms and firm innovation incentives. It highlights the context of the study (Korea post-1997 crisis) and the theoretical frameworks used (institution-based view and competitive strategy literature). Additionally, it summarizes the findings regarding the positive influence of market reforms on innovation, while noting the conditional nature of this influence based on firm-specific factors. This reasoning aligns with the detailed insights provided in the original abstract without delving into the specific methodologies employed in the research.",
