    "summary": "This paper investigates the motivations and strategies of nonstate armed groups, specifically focusing on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka, in their quest for recognition as sole representatives of their communities. The research explores whether this status is merely symbolic or provides tangible benefits. The LTTE's pursuit of this status involved three main strategies: eliminating rival groups, incorporating certain factions, and demonstrating military effectiveness. These strategies aimed to facilitate negotiations with the government and influence administrative structures. While they achieved some success, these tactics also contributed to the LTTE's eventual downfall in 2009, highlighting the complexities of their quest for representation.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by detailing the focus on nonstate rebels and their strategies for seeking representation. It reflects the key themes of motivation, strategy, and outcome, while avoiding specific mentions of the methodologies used. The reasoning aligns with the abstract's exploration of the LTTE's actions and the implications of their quest for sole representation.",
