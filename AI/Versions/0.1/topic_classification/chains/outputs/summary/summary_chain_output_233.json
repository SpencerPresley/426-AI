    "summary": "This research addresses the challenge of student retention in universities, particularly in regions with high enrollment rates. It explores the implementation of Living Learning Communities (LLCs) as a strategy to enhance retention, despite the anecdotal nature of existing evidence regarding their effectiveness. The findings indicate that participation in LLCs positively influences student retention and academic performance, especially during the early years of college.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the abstract by highlighting the main problem (student retention), the proposed solution (Living Learning Communities), and the positive outcomes observed (improved retention and GPA). It avoids discussing the specific methodologies used, focusing instead on the implications and results of the research.",
