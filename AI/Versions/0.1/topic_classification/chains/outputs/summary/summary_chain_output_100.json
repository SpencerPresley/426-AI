    "summary": "This article examines Aravind Adiga's Booker Prize-winning novel 'The White Tiger' through various interpretations of justice, particularly focusing on the experiences of marginalized individuals. It poses critical questions about the nature of justice when enacted by those who are socially disadvantaged, specifically those affected by caste and class dynamics. The author argues that the novel's portrayal of class, caste, poverty, and violence reflects broader concepts of justice. Furthermore, it advocates for a re-evaluation of postcolonial literary criticism to center the voices of the oppressed, rather than adhering to traditional narratives of colonial oppression. The essay ultimately seeks to inspire discussions about the representation of justice and human rights within literary contexts, engaging with established philosophical and legal frameworks.",
