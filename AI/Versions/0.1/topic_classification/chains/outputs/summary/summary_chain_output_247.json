    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of the order of concentric and eccentric muscle contractions on metabolic responses during resistance exercise. The study specifically compares the metabolic effects of performing squats in a monophasic manner (either concentric-only or eccentric-only) versus a mixed approach that alternates between concentric and eccentric contractions. The findings reveal that the order of contractions significantly influences metabolic rate and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC), with greater metabolic rates observed during concentric-eccentric squats, while EPOC was higher following eccentric-concentric squats. These results highlight the importance of contraction order in resistance training and its implications for optimizing metabolic responses.",
    "reasoning": "The summary emphasizes the core focus of the research, which is the effect of contraction order on metabolic responses in resistance training. It captures the essence of the study's aim, methods, and key findings without delving into specific methodologies. The reasoning reflects an understanding of the abstract's content and the significance of the results in the context of resistance training.",
