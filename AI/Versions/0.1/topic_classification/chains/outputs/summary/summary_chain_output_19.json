    "summary": "This research addresses the discrepancies in the understanding of probability vocabulary between students and mathematicians, emphasizing the necessity for a common understanding in educational contexts. It highlights the conflicts in current educational standards regarding vocabulary instruction and the importance of developing students' language skills. The study focuses on the vocabulary use of four students throughout a series of lessons, aiming to inform curriculum design and educational standards. Key concepts such as incrementality, multidimensionality, polysemy, interrelatedness, and heterogeneity are identified as essential for enhancing students' understanding of probability vocabulary.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main idea of the research, which is centered around improving students' understanding of probability vocabulary by addressing the differences in interpretation between students and mathematicians. It also notes the implications for curriculum and standards, reflecting the research's focus on educational improvement without delving into specific methodologies used.",
