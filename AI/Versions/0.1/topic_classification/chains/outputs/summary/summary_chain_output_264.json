    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of education on awareness and mitigation of natural disasters by analyzing its relationship with the World Risk Index (WRI). The study reveals that higher education levels correlate with increased awareness of natural hazards, suggesting that education plays a crucial role in reducing vulnerability to disasters. The findings indicate that countries with lower risk are often more aware of their hazards, while those at higher risk tend to lack sufficient awareness. Ultimately, the study concludes that enhancing education can significantly improve preparedness and response to natural disasters.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the central theme of the relationship between education and natural disaster awareness. It synthesizes the findings regarding the correlation between education levels and vulnerability to disasters, while also noting the implications for disaster preparedness. This approach avoids detailing the specific methodologies used, focusing instead on the main conclusions drawn from the research.",
