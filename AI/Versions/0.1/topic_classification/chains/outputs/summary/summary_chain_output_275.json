    "summary": "This research investigates the effects of transitioning a nursing course from a traditional face-to-face format to a hybrid model. The study assesses the impact on student performance, faculty workload, and associated costs. Findings indicate that while student exam scores remained comparable between the two delivery methods, there was a significant reduction in faculty workload by one third and a 16.6% decrease in overall costs. The results suggest that redesigning courses can effectively enhance efficiency without compromising educational outcomes.",
