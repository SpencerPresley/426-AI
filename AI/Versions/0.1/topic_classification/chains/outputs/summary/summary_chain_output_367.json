    "summary": "This research explores the factors influencing student retention and GPA among a large group of students at a U.S. public four-year university. The findings indicate that cognitive factors are positively linked to GPA throughout college, while non-cognitive factors play a more significant role in the earlier semesters. Based on these insights, the authors recommend that strategies aimed at improving retention should prioritize community-building efforts, whereas those focused on enhancing academic performance should emphasize the development of perseverance and study skills during the initial years of college.",
