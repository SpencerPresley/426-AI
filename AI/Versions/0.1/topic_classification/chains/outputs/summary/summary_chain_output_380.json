    "summary": "This research investigates the protective role of mangroves and coastal elevation in safeguarding economic activities from cyclone impacts in coastal regions. The study finds that both higher elevation and wider mangroves can provide shelter from indirect cyclone exposure, while protection from direct exposure requires both features. The results indicate that most of the areas benefiting from this protective capacity are located in upper middle-income countries, although they also significantly benefit populations in lower middle-income countries. This highlights the importance of understanding geographical and economic disparities in the effectiveness of coastal protection mechanisms.",
    "reasoning": "The summary focuses on the main findings and implications of the research without delving into the specific methodologies used. It captures the essence of the study by emphasizing the protective effects of mangroves and elevation against cyclones, the conditions under which this protection is effective, and the socioeconomic context of the affected regions. The reasoning behind the summary is to provide a clear and concise overview that reflects the abstract's primary themes and conclusions.",
