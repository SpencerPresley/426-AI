The study reveals that instructors, rather than students, were often the perpetrators of these incidents, which challenges previous findings in the literature. A total of 20 incidents were reported, categorized into six dominant themes, including issues of power dynamics, personal devaluation, and institutional racism. The implications for social justice education are discussed, along with specific recommendations for educators and academic institutions to address these issues effectively.",
