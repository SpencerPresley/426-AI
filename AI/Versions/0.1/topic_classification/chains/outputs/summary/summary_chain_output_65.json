    "summary": "This research investigates how increasing US federal regulations disproportionately affect small businesses, specifically in terms of employment and output. The study reveals that as regulations escalate, small firms experience a decline in both their share of industry employment and total output. Empirical evidence indicates that a 10% rise in federal regulations correlates with an approximate 0.8% reduction in small firms' employment share and a nearly 1.5% decrease in their output share.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, which is the impact of federal regulations on small businesses. It highlights the main findings regarding employment and output reductions without delving into the specific methodologies used. The reasoning provides a concise overview of the implications of the study, emphasizing the statistical relationships identified between regulation increases and the performance of small firms.",
