    "summary": "This study investigates how prospective elementary teachers make instructional decisions in mathematics and science based on evidence of student thinking. It highlights the importance of being responsive to students' ideas and the variability of teaching strategies across different subjects. The research emphasizes the need for teacher educators to support prospective teachers in developing effective practices that utilize student input. Additionally, the findings suggest that consistent questioning techniques can contribute to shared teaching practices, and the use of technology, such as animations, can enhance the learning experience for prospective teachers.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, which is on the decision-making processes of prospective teachers in relation to student thinking in mathematics and science.
