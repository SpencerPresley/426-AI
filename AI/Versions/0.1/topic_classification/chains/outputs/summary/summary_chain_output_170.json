    "summary": "This study examines the responses of LGBTQ+ individuals in the USA to the 2020 Presidential election, highlighting the impact of political discourse on their mental and physical health. The research reveals that political figures like Trump and Coney-Barrett are perceived as threats to LGBTQ+ rights, contributing to feelings of uncertainty about the future. While many participants engaged with political news to cope with election-related anxiety, there are concerns that a Biden victory could lead to complacency and division within the community. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding LGBTQ+ perspectives on political issues and suggest that inclusive policies could enhance political mobilization among diverse LGBTQ+ groups.",
