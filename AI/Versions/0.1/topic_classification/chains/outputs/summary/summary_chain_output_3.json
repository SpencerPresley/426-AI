    "summary": "This research investigates the disparities in access to primary care services among sexual minority (SM) adults in the United States, highlighting that these individuals experience significant barriers, particularly related to age and stigma. The study aims to understand how experiences of minority stress correlate with access to healthcare, revealing that higher levels of felt stigma are associated with a lower likelihood of having a primary care provider. Notably, this negative association is particularly pronounced among younger SM adults, indicating that unique experiences of minority stress contribute to obstacles in accessing essential healthcare services.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the main findings regarding healthcare access disparities among sexual minority adults. It emphasizes the role of minority stress and stigma as key factors affecting access to primary care, particularly among younger individuals. The reasoning is based on the detailed exploration of the abstract, which outlines the purpose, findings, and implications of the study without delving into specific methodologies or statistical techniques used.",
