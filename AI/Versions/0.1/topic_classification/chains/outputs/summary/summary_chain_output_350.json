    "summary": "This research addresses the challenges of implementing case-based teaching in universities where such methods are not typically used. It introduces effective strategies for facilitating the case analysis process, aiming to enhance both student performance and faculty efficiency. The study highlights that a structured, shorter case analysis leads to improved grading efficiency and better student outcomes. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of instructional support, such as lectures and group practice, in further enhancing student performance in case analysis. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of the findings and suggesting areas for future research.",
