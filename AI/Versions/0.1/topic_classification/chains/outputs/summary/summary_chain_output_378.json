    "summary": "The research investigates how the communication of donation amounts in cause-related marketing (CM) influences consumer perceptions, particularly regarding price fairness and skepticism towards firms' motives. It highlights that while transparent communication of monetary donations can enhance campaign effectiveness, many firms still opt for ambiguous descriptions. The findings from three studies reveal that there are specific conditions under which the use of monetary quantifiers may backfire, leading to increased skepticism among consumers. The studies also discuss strategies for practitioners to effectively manage consumer skepticism to improve perceptions of fairness and boost purchase intent.",
