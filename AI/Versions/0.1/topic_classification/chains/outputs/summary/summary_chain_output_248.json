    "summary": "The research evaluates statewide initiatives aimed at addressing the shortages of registered nurses and nursing faculty, funded by a portion of hospital-based revenue. Over a four-year period from 2016 to 2020, $90 million was allocated to support 24 nursing programs through competitive grants, which facilitated the preparation and advancement of 532 faculty members. The outcomes of these initiatives were significant, showing a 73% increase in the number of doctoral degrees conferred and the addition of 162 full-time and 190 part-time faculty to the workforce, demonstrating the effectiveness of the funding in resolving the identified shortages.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the abstract by outlining the primary focus on statewide initiatives to mitigate nursing shortages through financial support. It highlights the funding amount, the number of programs and faculty involved, and the positive outcomes achieved, such as increased doctoral degree conferrals and faculty additions. This encapsulates the main idea of the research without delving into specific methodologies, aligning with the requirement to focus on the main idea rather than the methods.",
