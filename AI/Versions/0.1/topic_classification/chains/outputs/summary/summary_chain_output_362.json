    "summary": "This research explores the effects of market liberalization on technology exploration strategies within firms in South Korea. It identifies a U-shaped relationship, indicating that as market liberalization increases, technology exploration initially declines before rising again at higher levels of liberalization. Furthermore, the study examines how factors such as financial slack and industry concentration negatively affect this relationship, while belonging to a business group enhances it. These findings reveal the complex dynamics between market conditions and firm strategies in the context of technological innovation.",
