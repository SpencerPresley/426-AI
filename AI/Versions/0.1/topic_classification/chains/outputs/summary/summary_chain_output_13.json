    "summary": "This research investigates the growth rate of the fish species Fundulus heteroclitus under varying conditions of dissolved oxygen and temperature. The study finds that extreme fluctuations in dissolved oxygen negatively affect growth at higher temperatures but not at lower ones. In contrast, moderate variations in dissolved oxygen do not impact growth. Additionally, the fish do not acclimate to the adverse effects of extreme conditions over time. The results suggest that the interaction between dissolved oxygen levels and temperature is significant for growth, while changes in pH do not independently affect growth. The study also highlights concerning levels of carbon dioxide, which are projected to be much higher than current oceanic levels by the year 2100, indicating potential ecological implications.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main findings of the research, focusing on how various environmental conditions affect the growth of Fundulus heteroclitus. It emphasizes the negative impacts of extreme dissolved oxygen fluctuations and temperature interactions while noting the lack of significant effects from moderate pH changes. The mention of elevated carbon dioxide levels adds context to the ecological relevance of the findings. This summary effectively distills the core message of the abstract without delving into the specific methodologies used, adhering to the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
