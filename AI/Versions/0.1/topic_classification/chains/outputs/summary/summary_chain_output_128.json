    "summary": "The research investigates the potential impacts of climate change on storm surges and flooding in the Chesapeake Bay area, using Hurricane Isabel as a historical case study. It finds that future warming is likely to intensify storms, leading to increased storm surge and coastal inundation. Projections indicate that the inundated area will significantly expand by 2050 and 2100, with a notable increase in the number of houses at risk of flooding and substantial economic damages in urban areas like Baltimore. The study highlights the uncertainties associated with different climate change scenarios and model projections.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main findings and implications of the research without delving into the specific methodologies used. It focuses on the effects of climate change on flooding and storm intensity, the projected increases in inundation and damage, and the uncertainties involved, which are central themes in the abstract. This approach allows for a clear understanding of the research's contributions and significance.",
