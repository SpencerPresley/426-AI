    "summary": "The abstract discusses the persistent issue of nurse faculty shortages and evaluates the effectiveness of various strategies implemented over the past decade, particularly focusing on a statewide nursing scholarship-for-service program. This program has provided over $11 million in scholarships to 250 recipients, who are required to teach in return for their financial support. The findings indicate mixed results regarding the program's impact, and the abstract concludes with recommendations for improving the program's cost-effectiveness to better address the ongoing shortage of nursing educators.",
