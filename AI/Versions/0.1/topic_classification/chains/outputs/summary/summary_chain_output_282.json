    "summary": "This research investigates the phenomenon of cross-modal stimulation, where stimulation in one sensory modality enhances perception in another. The study focuses on wild-caught tungara frogs, known for their distinct acoustic preferences, and explores how combined visual and seismic cues influence female frogs' choices between male courtship calls. The findings demonstrate that these combined stimuli can restore typical acoustic preferences even in noisy environments, suggesting that cross-modal stimulation enhances attentional focus and decision-making. The work lays the groundwork for future studies on the mechanisms and contexts that facilitate cross-modal facilitation effects.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by emphasizing the main focus on cross-modal stimulation and its effects on the decision-making process of tungara frogs. It highlights the relevance of combined sensory cues and their impact on behavior, while also addressing the implications for future research. This approach avoids detailing specific methodologies, aligning with the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
