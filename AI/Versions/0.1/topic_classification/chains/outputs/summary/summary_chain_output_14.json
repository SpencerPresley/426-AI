    "summary": "This study investigates the role of resilience in the context of psychological distress, academic burnout, and student attrition among business students at various U.S. universities. The researchers aimed to determine if resilience serves as a mitigating or moderating factor in the relationships between psychological distress and academic burnout, and the intention to leave school. The findings reveal that while resilience does not moderate these relationships, it does reduce their impact by being negatively associated with psychological distress and certain burnout factors. The study suggests that enhancing resilience could be an effective strategy for educators to reduce student turnover and better prepare students for workplace challenges.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the primary aim, which is to explore the relationship between resilience and student challenges such as distress and burnout. It highlights the main findings regarding the role of resilience and its implications for educational practices, without delving into specific methodologies used in the study. This approach ensures that the summary remains aligned with the main idea of the research.",
