    "summary": "This paper argues that scholars of World English (WE) should be cautious about the shift from diverse linguistic practices in postcolonial literature to a more uniform approach influenced by globalized fiction, which obscures significant linguistic hierarchies. It highlights the importance of recognizing the linguistic asymmetries emphasized by Braj B. Kachru, despite contemporary trends that focus on contextual and spatial analyses. The research asserts that Kachru's frameworks remain relevant in understanding the complexities of language use in a globalized context.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core argument of the paper, which is the need for vigilance among WE scholars regarding the evolving linguistic landscape in postcolonial literature. It reflects the tension between the historical diversity of language practices and the current trend towards uniformity, while also acknowledging the ongoing relevance of Kachru's theories. The summary avoids specific methodologies, focusing instead on the thematic concerns presented in the abstract.",
