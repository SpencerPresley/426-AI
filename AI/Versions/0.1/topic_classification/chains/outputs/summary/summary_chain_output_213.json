    "summary": "The research paper explores the complex role of borders in human life and their significant impact on social work. It highlights the varying nature of borders, which can be either permeable or rigid, affecting movement and creating social and economic disparities. The authors argue that these differences necessitate attention from social work practitioners and that the ongoing global issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have reshaped our understanding of borders. The paper aims to clarify how social work engages with border-related issues, emphasizing the need for a distinct focus on borders apart from existing discussions on globalization and immigration. Through comparative analysis of three international border cases, the authors seek to draw insights that can enhance social work practice and provoke further discussion on these critical issues.",
