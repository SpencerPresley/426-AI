    "summary": "This research investigates the responses of school district leadership in Maryland to revised state guidelines for student codes of conduct, focusing on the changes in disciplinary practices over a three-year period. The study highlights the increasing availability of diverse response options to infractions, particularly for serious offenses, and notes a trend towards less exclusionary disciplinary measures. However, it also identifies that many districts have adopted stricter disciplinary options than those recommended by the state. The findings emphasize the complexities and implications of implementing school discipline reforms in the context of ongoing efforts to improve educational equity and discipline practices.",
