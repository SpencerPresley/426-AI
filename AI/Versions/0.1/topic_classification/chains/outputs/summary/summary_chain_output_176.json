    "summary": "This research investigates how the increasing demand for contactless payment methods influences consumer perceptions and retailer attitudes. Despite the growing trend toward contactless payments, there is a notable lack of research on consumer perceptions in this area. The study reveals that consumers view contactless payment options as less contaminated compared to traditional methods like cash and credit cards, leading to more favorable attitudes towards retailers that offer these technologies. However, the advantages of contactless payments may be diminished for retailers whose customers prefer cash, which is perceived as contaminated.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main themes of the research, focusing on consumer perceptions of contactless payment methods versus traditional ones, and the implications for retailers. It highlights the positive consumer attitudes towards contactless payments while addressing the potential limitations based on customer preferences for cash. This aligns with the findings and discussions presented in the abstract without delving into the specific methods used in the research.",
