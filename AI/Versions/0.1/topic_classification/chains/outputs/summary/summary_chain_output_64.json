    "summary": "This research investigates the relationship between women's sexual satisfaction with their current partner and their history of sexual victimization, specifically focusing on whether the perpetrator was their current partner or someone else. The study samples 412 unmarried undergraduate women from a U.S. public university, assessing their sexual satisfaction and history of victimization. The findings reveal that sexual victimization by the current partner is significantly linked to lower sexual satisfaction, while victimization by others does not have the same effect. This suggests that the context of victimization is crucial in understanding women's sexual satisfaction, indicating a need for further exploration of how partner-related factors influence sexual health outcomes.",
