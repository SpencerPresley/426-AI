    "summary": "This research investigates the role of tool use in the evolution of hominins, particularly focusing on its impact on the dietary habits of wild capuchin monkeys that use stone tools to crack palm nuts. The study reveals that tool use enhances dietary consistency, increases net energy gain, and alters macronutrient intake patterns, suggesting that early tool use may have significantly improved the nutritional security of ancestral hominins and contributed to cultural development.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core findings of the research, highlighting the relationship between tool use and dietary benefits. It emphasizes the implications of these findings for understanding the evolutionary significance of tool use in hominins without delving into specific methodologies. The reasoning reflects the abstract's emphasis on how tool use may have influenced both the nutritional intake of capuchin monkeys and the broader evolutionary context for early humans.",
