    "summary": "This research addresses the challenges of measuring team performance in collegiate lacrosse, particularly due to the lack of reliable metrics. The study introduces a new metric, LAX-Score, designed to quantify athletic performance and enhance understanding of team dynamics beyond traditional win-loss records. By exploring the relationship between LAX-Score and various practice features, the research aims to provide insights into performance improvement. The findings suggest that LAX-Score offers a more nuanced view of athletic performance, and initial applications of the metric in practice show promising results despite disruptions caused by COVID-19.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is the development of the LAX-Score metric and its implications for measuring team performance. It highlights the importance of the metric in providing deeper insights into athletic performance and acknowledges the challenges faced during the implementation phase due to COVID-19. The summary avoids detailing the specific methodologies used, aligning with the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
