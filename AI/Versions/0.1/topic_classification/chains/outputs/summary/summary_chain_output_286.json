    "summary": "The research investigates the relationships between different styles of humor and various psychological and social outcomes, including well-being, social support, cognitive reappraisal, and social competence. Two studies were conducted: the first study revealed that self-enhancing and affiliative humor were linked to better health and lower psychological distress, while self-defeating humor was associated with increased distress. Additionally, aggressive humor's impact on social support was moderated by social competence. The second study tracked undergraduates over ten weeks and confirmed the findings of the first study, demonstrating that social support and cognitive reappraisal mediated the relationships between humor styles and psychological distress. The studies also found that aggressive humor was linked to health difficulties and that communication challenges affected the social interactions of individuals with aggressive humor. Overall, the findings highlight the complex interplay between humor styles and psychological health, suggesting that certain humor styles can be beneficial while others may lead to negative outcomes.",
