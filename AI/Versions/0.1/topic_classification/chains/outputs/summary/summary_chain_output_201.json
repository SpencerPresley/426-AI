    "summary": "This research investigates the slower growth of private labels in emerging markets compared to their significant presence in Europe and North America, where private labels account for about 35% of total retail market share. In contrast, private label shares in emerging markets are much lower, ranging from 1% to 8%. The study critiques existing explanations for this discrepancy, emphasizing that they overlook the unique dynamics between manufacturers and retailers in these economies. It highlights that national brand manufacturers often serve as the sole producers of private labels in emerging markets. The research explores the bargaining power of these manufacturers relative to retailers and examines how this power affects private label market shares. Findings reveal that dominant manufacturers set high wholesale prices for private labels, resulting in higher retail prices and consequently lower market shares for these products in emerging markets.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research, focusing on the disparity in private label growth between emerging and developed markets, the unique manufacturer-retailer relationships, and the implications of manufacturers' bargaining power on market shares. This approach avoids detailing the specific methodologies used, aligning with the requirement to present the main idea of the research without methodological concerns.",
