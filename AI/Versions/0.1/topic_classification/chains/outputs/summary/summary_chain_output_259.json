    "summary": "The research explores the historical significance of the Knights of Labor's cooperative movement in the United States from 1870 to 1889, highlighting its role as a viable alternative to capitalism in the context of growing social inequality. It investigates how these cooperatives aimed to empower workers and restore their independence in an industrializing economy. The study reveals that the cooperatives were founded on American republican ideals and adopted governance structures akin to corporations, which contributed to their initial success. However, it also examines the reasons behind the eventual failures of both the Knights and their cooperatives, discussing their legacy and suggesting areas for future research.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the abstract by focusing on the Knights of Labor's cooperative movement as a response to social class disparities and its implications for worker empowerment. It emphasizes the historical context, the ideological foundations of the cooperatives, and the dual focus on success and failure, which are central themes in the abstract. The summary avoids mentioning specific methodologies, aligning with the requirement to focus solely on the main idea of the research.",
