    "summary": "This study investigates how male and female candidates for principal positions utilize language to express their values in job applications. By analyzing application data from Wisconsin school leaders, the research seeks to identify potential differences in language presentation between genders during the initial application phase. The findings reveal significant differences in language use: female candidates tend to elaborate on ideas and employ comparison techniques, while male candidates often adopt a more formal tone and rely on passive voice. The results raise questions about potential unconscious biases in the selection process, suggesting that language patterns associated with each gender may influence hiring decisions.",
