    "summary": "This research investigates the factors influencing turnover intentions among direct care workers (DCWs) in China's aged care sector. It highlights the importance of retention rates for maintaining quality care and identifies a significant gap in existing literature regarding the factors affecting retention. The study reveals that DCWs working in hospitals have higher employment contract rates and lower turnover intentions compared to those in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). The findings indicate that contractual status and the type of facility are critical in determining turnover intentions, with a recommendation for increasing the use of employment contracts to enhance job security and reduce turnover. Additionally, the study calls for regulatory measures under Chinese Labor Law to improve working conditions for DCWs.",
