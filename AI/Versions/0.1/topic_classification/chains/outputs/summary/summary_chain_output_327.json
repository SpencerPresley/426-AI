    "summary": "The research investigates the relationship between body-esteem and experiences of sexual victimization among undergraduate women. It identifies a significant gap in existing literature regarding this topic. The study involved 750 participants and categorized their experiences of sexual victimization into different types. Results indicate that women without any history of sexual victimization and those with sexual contact experience reported higher body-esteem compared to those who experienced coercion, attempted coercion, or rape. Additionally, it was found that attempted rape survivors had higher body-esteem than those who experienced coercion or no victimization at all. The findings suggest a negative association between body-esteem and certain types of sexual victimization, while indicating that escaping rape may enhance positive body image.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the main focus on body-esteem in relation to various types of sexual victimization. It reflects the study's contribution to the literature by identifying the specific experiences examined and the outcomes related to body-esteem levels among the participants. Furthermore, it encapsulates the key findings and implications of the research without delving into the specific methodologies used, aligning with the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
