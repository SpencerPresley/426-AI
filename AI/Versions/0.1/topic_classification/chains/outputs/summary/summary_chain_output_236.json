    "summary": "The research investigates a systematic bias in how individuals estimate the agreement of others with their viewpoints, particularly in the context of climate change. It reveals that the majority of people who believe in climate change underestimate the level of agreement among others, while those who do not believe in climate change overestimate it. This pattern is consistent across various contemporary issues with majority/minority dynamics. The study also finds that individuals with greater certainty about their beliefs tend to have more accurate perceptions of consensus, while those with lower certainty have less accurate estimates. Additionally, the research suggests that increased exposure to discussions about climate change can enhance certainty and understanding. The findings imply that strategies such as providing accurate information and tailoring communication based on belief certainty may influence public opinion and engagement regarding climate change.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by outlining the main findings related to consensus bias in belief about climate change, emphasizing the differences in perception between majority and minority groups. It includes key insights about the relationship between certainty and accuracy of belief estimates, as well as the implications for public engagement strategies. This reasoning is based on the detailed analysis of the abstract, which highlights the systematic bias and its potential effects on public opinion.",
