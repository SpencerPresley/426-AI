    "feedback": {
        "methodologies_feedback": "The methodologies identified are relevant and accurately reflect the research themes discussed in the abstract. However, it may be beneficial to clarify the distinction between methods and themes more explicitly, as some identified methodologies could be interpreted as broad thematic elements rather than specific methods. This could help in refining the method extraction process in future analyses.",
        "abstract_sentence_analysis_feedback": "The sentence-level analysis is thorough and provides a clear understanding of each component of the abstract. However, it would be helpful to ensure that the meanings assigned to sentences are consistently linked to the overarching themes of the abstract. A stronger emphasis on how each sentence contributes to the overall theme could enhance clarity and facilitate a more cohesive summary."
