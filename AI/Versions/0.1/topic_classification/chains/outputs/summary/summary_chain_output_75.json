    "summary": "This research investigates the early parenting experiences of parents with pre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) youth, highlighting the significant impact of parental support on the psychosocial outcomes of these children. The study reveals that many parents became aware of their child's TGNC identity at a young age, typically around 3.5 years, through either observing gender behaviors or direct communication from the child. Emotional responses among parents varied, with many expressing neutrality or positivity regarding their child's non-conformity to traditional gender roles. Additionally, parents who lacked prior knowledge about transgender issues sought information online to better understand their child's experiences. The findings contribute to existing literature by suggesting new areas for research and ways to support TGNC youth and their families more effectively.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the main findings regarding parental awareness, emotional responses, and the need for better support for TGNC youth. It avoids discussing the specific methodologies used, aligning with the requirement to concentrate on the research's main idea rather than the methods employed. The summary reflects the abstract's key themes, including the importance of parental support and the emotional complexities surrounding the recognition of a child's gender identity.",
