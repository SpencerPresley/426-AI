    "summary": "The research investigates diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a condition affecting a significant proportion of diabetic patients, for which the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. The authors introduce a new zebrafish model to study acute DPN, revealing that acute hyperglycemia leads to structural changes in sensory and motor nerves before any behavioral symptoms appear. Notably, they observe abnormal neuron positioning and disrupted nerve insulation in the treated zebrafish. This model presents a valuable opportunity for further exploration of the molecular mechanisms associated with DPN, potentially guiding future therapeutic strategies.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main focus of the research, which is the introduction of a zebrafish model for studying DPN and the unexpected findings regarding nerve changes due to hyperglycemia. It avoids detailing specific methodologies, instead emphasizing the significance of the findings and their implications for understanding DPN and developing treatments. This approach aligns with the requirement to focus on the main idea rather than the methods employed.",
