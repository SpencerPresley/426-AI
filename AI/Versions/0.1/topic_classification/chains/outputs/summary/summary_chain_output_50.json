    "summary": "This research investigates the often-overlooked positive effects of customer courtesy on service employees, highlighting its potential to enhance service performance through increased employee self-efficacy. The authors argue that while organizations cannot directly control customer behavior, they can foster a supportive organizational climate to maximize the benefits of customer courtesy. The study finds that customer courtesy significantly impacts employee self-efficacy and service performance, with this effect being stronger in environments with high organizational support. The findings underscore the importance of positive interactions in the workplace for improving employee outcomes, despite the prevailing notion that negative experiences may have a more substantial impact.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, which is the relationship between customer courtesy and employee performance, mediated by self-efficacy. It emphasizes the role of organizational support as a facilitator of these positive effects, aligning with the abstract's main ideas. The reasoning also reflects the contrast made in the abstract between negative and positive customer interactions, which is a significant theme throughout the research.",
    "feedback": {
        "methodologies_feedback": "The methodologies identified were relevant and provided a good foundation for understanding the research approach. However, it would be beneficial to include a brief explanation of how the developed customer courtesy scale was utilized in the studies, as this would provide a clearer context for its significance in the research. Additionally, a more explicit connection between the methods and the outcomes could enhance understanding.",
        "abstract_sentence_analysis_feedback": "The sentence analysis was thorough and accurately captured the meanings of each sentence. However, it could be improved by summarizing the implications of the findings more explicitly, linking them back to the overall theme of the research. A clearer articulation of how the results contribute to existing literature on customer interactions and employee performance would also strengthen the analysis."
