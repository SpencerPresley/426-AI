                "abstract": "This study examined how firms combine alliances and acquisitions in an exploration/exploitation framework. By conducting cluster analysis on a sample of 1270 acquisitions made by 836 firms, we first identified the patterns in alliance and acquisition activities undertaken by these firms. Five distinct patterns were identified: (I) low alliance-low acquisition, (II) low alliance-high acquisition, (III) high alliance-low acquisition, (IV) high alliance-high acquisition, and (V) medium alliance-very high acquisition. Next, we analyzed the different ways in which the two modes were interlinked within these five patterns for exploration/exploitation. Patterns III and IV appeared to involve both exploration/exploitation and mutually reinforce exploration/exploitation. In contrast, in the remaining patterns, the two modes appeared to be more loosely coupled with each other, with a focus on exploitation.",

It examines different patterns in these activities and their implications for exploration and exploitation strategies. This fits well within the category of 'Business administration and management' as it deals with strategic management decisions and organizational behavior in the context of business growth and development.",

Understanding the exploration/exploitation framework required some consideration, but it is a well-known concept in business strategy.",

The categories are quite broad, and the research's emphasis on strategic management and decision-making led to the classification under business management and administration. Understanding where to draw the line in terms of specificity for 'Business administration and management nec' was also a consideration, but the broad nature of the study justified its inclusion.",
