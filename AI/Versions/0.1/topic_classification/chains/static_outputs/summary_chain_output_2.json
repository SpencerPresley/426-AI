    "summary": "This research investigates how managers' perceptions of employees' organizational commitment influence their evaluations of the employees' career growth opportunities. The study finds that managers use employees' attitudes and behaviors, such as extra-role performance and work engagement, to gauge their commitment to the organization. Employees perceived as highly committed to the organization are given better career growth opportunities. Additionally, the positive impact of perceived organizational commitment on career growth opportunities is stronger for employees who are also seen as highly committed to their own careers.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research, which is to explore the relationship between managers' perceptions of employees' organizational commitment and the employees' career growth opportunities. The study highlights that managers rely on specific employee behaviors to assess commitment and that this perceived commitment leads to enhanced career growth opportunities. Furthermore, the study notes that the effect is more pronounced for employees who are also highly committed to their own careers. This encapsulates the core findings and implications of the research without delving into the specific methodologies used.",
