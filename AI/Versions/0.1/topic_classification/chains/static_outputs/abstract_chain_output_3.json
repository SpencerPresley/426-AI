    "detailed_summary": "The study explores the combination of alliances and acquisitions by firms within an exploration/exploitation framework. Using cluster analysis on a sample of 1270 acquisitions by 836 firms, the researchers identified five distinct patterns of alliance and acquisition activities: low alliance-low acquisition, low alliance-high acquisition, high alliance-low acquisition, high alliance-high acquisition, and medium alliance-very high acquisition. The analysis revealed that in patterns III (high alliance-low acquisition) and IV (high alliance-high acquisition), alliances and acquisitions both involved and reinforced exploration and exploitation strategies. In contrast, the other patterns showed a looser connection between the two modes, with a primary focus on exploitation."
