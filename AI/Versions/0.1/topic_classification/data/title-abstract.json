    "High-Throughput, Fluorescent Analysis of Reactive Oxygen Species in C. elegans after Knockdown of mrck-1": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in living organisms can generate oxidative stress, which contributes to cell damage associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Studying responses to oxidative stress in model organisms, like the nematode wormCaenorhabditis elegans, may provide insight into basic underlying cellular mechanisms shared with humans. MRCK-1 (myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42 binding kinase), a highly conserved intracellular kinase, is activated by the G-protein, Cdc42, which contains a redox sensitive motif. Previous studies have shown that MRCK-1 regulates cell polarity and cytoskeleton reorganization, particularly during cell division and in response to cellular damage. To determine if MRCK-1 plays a role in other cellular defense responses, we are testing if RNA interference (RNAi) ofmrck-1results in the production of more ROS under stressed conditions. The cell permeable fluorescent ROS indicator, carboxymethyl dichlorodihydrofluorescein derivative, CM-H2DCFDA, shows significantly increased fluorescence in hydrogen peroxide-treated worms when quantified using the SpectraMax microplate reader. Oxidative stress conditions were induced with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the presence of CM-H2DCFDA, and fluorescence was measured over a period of 20 hours. Measuring the fluorescence of worms exposed to dsRNA from two independentmrck-1RNAi constructs,mrck-mandmrck-s, enables the quantification of ROS levels when MRCK-1 function is decreased. Exploring the levels of ROS in RNAi-treated. elegansmay give further insight into the cellular role of MRCK-1 both in worms and in humans.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nSpecial acknowledgments to the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Henson Undergraduate Research Award, and the National Science Foundation MRI Acquisition Award DBI-1337534 for support.\n",
    "Isolation, Identification, and Characterization of Local Wild Yeasts for Use In Fermentation": "Inspired by spontaneously fermented beers, such as Belgian Lambic beers, American breweries have moved beyond using exclusively domesticated strains of the beer-making yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to experimenting with a variety of different yeast species to produce unique flavors and aromas. The so-called \"funky,\" \"wild,\" and \"sour,\" beers are produced using uncommon microorganisms either during or after the primary ferment. The goal of our research is to isolate, identify, and characterize wild yeasts from the local environment and to make them available to both commercial and craft brewers for making novel beers. The use of locally-sourced yeasts could also be used by commercial brewers as a marketing angle, as is often done with local hops, grains, or water. As a source of wild yeasts, we obtained various wild and cultivated fruits growing in rural Maryland and a sample of Belgium-style ale being aged in used oak wine barrels at Evolution Craft Brewing Company (Salisbury, MD). Yeast colonies were isolated using yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) agar plates containing antibiotics and identified by colony morphology as well as PCR amplification and sequencing of the 5.8S rRNA genes. The identified yeasts belong toSaccharomyces,Pichia,Candida, Fusarium,Torulaspora,and, most interestingly,Brettanomycesgenera. TheBrettanomycesyeast, which was isolated from the wine barrel ale, is normally considered a wine spoilage yeast but increasingly is being employed to create \"funky\" and sour flavors in beer. The growth and fermentation abilities of eight different yeast isolates were analyzed for growth in different liquid medias (YPD, hopped barley-malt extract, and merlot grape juice) using 96-well plates and spectroscopy. Growth rates were calculated using a modified grofit package in RStudio. Ethanol production will be determined using a colorimetric assay. Thus far, the most compelling discovery is a wild strain ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaethat grows comparable to a commercially-available brewing yeast and produces pleasant, fruity aromas when fermenting barley malt extract. The complete characterization of these wild yeasts will be reported in order to identify novel wild yeasts that can be domesticated for local craft brewers.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nSpecial acknowledgments to the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Henson Undergraduate Research Award, Evolution Craft Brewery, and the National Science Foundation for funding and equipment, as well as Dr. Philip D.

    "Identification of an Arabidopsis WD-Repeat Protein that Activates the Deubiquitinase UBP3 and Interacts with Two E3 Ubiquitin Ligases": "Ubiquitination is an essential, dynamic post-translational modification that regulates a diverse set of cellular processes. Ligation of the small peptide ubiquitin (Ub) onto substrate proteins by E3 Ub ligases can change protein localization, activity or stability. The most common outcome for Ub-tagged proteins is degradation via the 26S proteasome. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) reverse the effects of ubiquitination by removing Ub from tagged substrates. In animals, Ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) 12 and USP46 are related DUBs that regulate key proteins in important growth and differentiation signaling pathways. USP12 and USP46 each form trimeric complexes with two WD-repeat (WDR) proteins, WDR20 and WDR48. The WDR proteins activate the enzymatic abilities of the DUBs while potentially serving as substrate receptors. Numerous animal and fungal DUBs are bound and activated by specific WDR proteins. InArabidopsis, Ub-specific proteases 3 (AtUBP3) and 4 (AtUBP4) are related DUBs that have significant sequence similarities to animal USP12/46. Genetic studies have shown AtUBP3/4 are essential for proper pollen development and transmission. It is not yet known if WDR proteins bind and activate DUBs in plants. We have identified At2g37160 as a likelyArabidopsisWDR20 homolog based on amino acid sequence homology and the number and organization of WD motifs. We have shown At2g37160 (AtWDR20) interacts with both AtUBP3 and AtUBP4 in the yeast two-hybrid system. Biochemical characterization using recombinant proteins shows AtWDR20 increases the DUB activity of AtUBP3 over nine-fold. A yeast two-hybrid screen of anArabidopsiscDNA library using AtWDR20 as bait revealed interactions between AtWDR20 and two different E3 Ub ligases: Myb-30 Interacting E3 Ub ligase (MIEL1) and CHY Zinc-finger and Ring Protein 1 (CHYR1). Interactions between a DUB-associated WDR protein and E3 Ub ligases is intriguing, and implies AtWDR20 may function on both sides of the Ub cycle or is itself a target of ubiquitination.In plantaandin vitroanalyses will further characterize the interactions between AtWDR20, AtUBP3, and these E3 ligases.\n",
    "Breaking Boundaries: Complementary and Alternative Medicine Provider Framing of Preventive Care": "This textual examination extends understandings of how complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers constitute preventive care in their discourse by identifying the frame of breaking boundaries referencing relational, structural, and philosophical orientations in their practice with their clients. Analysis of semistructured, in-depth interviews with CAM providers ( n = 17) reveals that the frame of breaking boundaries was comprised of three themes: finding one's own strength; I don't prescribe, so I'm exploring; and ground yourself, and have an escape route. The themes describe preventive care by identifying how CAM providers negotiate their relational positionality in connecting with clients, structural positionality within the field of health care, and philosophical positionality within the ontological understandings that guide how health is defined and conceptualized. The study contributes toward enhancing diverse understandings of constituting preventive care in practice and suggests pragmatic implications for addressing biomedical provider communication with their patients seeking CAM care alongside conventional treatments.\n",
    "Psychological Literacy in Applied Psychology Disciplines": "Undergraduate psychology majors need a broad base of knowledge in order to be viewed as competent graduates. In addition to acquiring basic knowledge, the American Psychological Association (APA) has guidelines for applied knowledge as well. In order to ensure a broad base of knowledge, teachers therefore need to know what the important psychological concepts are not only in both basic and applied areas of psychology. We examined key concepts across five applied areas of psychology and identified 30 key concepts that occur in two or more applied areas of psychology. It is evident from our findings that there is notable intersection between applied psychology and basic psychological science but also important applied concepts that stand alone from basic psychology. We discuss how these findings are directly relevant to APA's undergraduate learning goal of psychological literacy.\n",
    "Shadow and Spillover Effects of Competition in NBA Playoffs": "The National Basketball Association (NBA) playoffs are structured as an elimination tournament where reseeding does not occur after each round. This structure leads to situations where future competitors (the shadow effect) and previous effort (the spillover effect) affect current performance. Using data from the 2009-2014 NBA playoffs, results here find that, when a future opponent is known, a series favorite is significantly more likely to win a game when the future opponent is weaker than expected. Estimates also provide evidence that greater previous effort by teams increases the probability the series favorite wins a game.\n",
    "Local distribution of native and invasive earthworms and effects on a native salamander": "North America is home to both native and invasive earthworms acting as ecosystem engineers as they build burrows that can serve as habitat for other species or otherwise alter soil structure, affecting nutrient cycling and other ecosystem processes. Here I determine where and what earthworm species commonly occur in my study area, and compare effects of native and invasive earthworms on the common woodland salamander,Plethodon cinereus, in field surveys and laboratory experiments. The native earthwormEisenoides carolinensiswas the most common earthworm, followed by two invasive speciesDendrobaena octaedraandOctolasion tyrtaeum. The presence ofO. tyrtaeumwas associated with a narrower O-horizon (i.e., organic layer in the soil). Using structural equation modeling to explore direct and indirect pathways of these three most common earthworm species on salamanders, I foundO. tyrtaeumoccurrence was negatively correlated with nighttime salamander counts, a proxy for total salamander numbers, mediated by negative effects on O-horizon depth and microinvertebrate numbers. In the laboratory,O. tyrtaeumandD. octaedraconsumed more leaf litter per gram of earthworm per day than the nativeE. carolinensis. However, salamanders consumed earthworms and used burrows of all native and invasive species of earthworms similarly. The potential for negative indirect effects of the invasive earthwormO. tyrtaeumonP. cinereuswas demonstrated both in the field and laboratory, highlighting that seemingly small differences between native and invasive ecosystem engineers have the potential to significantly alter the effects of these closely related native and invasive organisms.\n",
    "Quantifying Federal Regulatory Burdens in the Beer Value Chain": "While the literature has discussed the impacts of specific regulations in the broader marketplace, nothing has been published that identifies the total number of federal regulatory restrictions imposed upon an entire agribusiness value chain. This letter uses a dataset generated via machine learning methods to count the total number of federal regulations imposed on the beer value chain. We show that 94,212 federal regulatory constraints influenced the beer value chained in 2012, with the majority of constraints being imposed at the brewery level.

    "Managers' Assessments of Employees' Organizational Career Growth Opportunities: The Role of Extra-Role Performance, Work Engagement, and Perceived Organizational Commitment": "This study examined the role of perceived organizational commitment on managers' assessments of employees' career growth opportunities. Based on a paired sample of 161 legal secretaries and their managers, results indicated that managers used the attitudes and behaviors displayed by employees (strong extra-role performance and enhanced work engagement) as cues from which to base their perceptions of employees' affective commitment to the organization. In turn, employees perceived as highly committed to the organization experienced enhanced content and structural career growth opportunities. Moreover, the relation between managers' perceptions of employees' organizational commitment and content career growth opportunities was stronger for employees perceived as also highly committed to their careers than for employees perceived as less committed to their careers.\n",
    "\"When size matters\"": "This paper examines the in-built message modality of Republican Party campaign yard signage in the 2016 U.S. Presidential race, and argues for a 'reading' in which known and unknown contender biographical details and idiolectal patterns form a key component in analyses using material ethnography. Examining the grammar of visuality in which typographic choice, toponymic-allusion, punctuational detail, as well as onomastics and embedded speech acts emerge ripe in literal and metaphoric meaning, the paper demonstrates how acts of intertextual chaining of political history and candidate biography re-affirm the need for interpretive frameworks which are dynamic - not static - and which are simultaneously incorporative of exophoric text-context accounts of witnessed signage. The in-built potential of campaign yard signage in triggering contagious and conspicuous acts of affective stance-taking particularly in neighborhoods of geospatial contiguity are examined both for how they fit into LL research, as well as for how they prod further innovation in its interdisciplinary-inspired and evolving frameworks of analysis.\n",
    "The Saharan Air Layer as an Early Rainfall Season Suppressant in the Eastern Caribbean: The 2015 Puerto Rico Drought": "Eastern Puerto Rico and the surrounding Caribbean experienced a severe drought in 2015 that resulted in record-low reservoir and river levels. Rainfall deficits in April and May, which represent the period when the drought began, were more severe in 2015 than recent droughts of record. While El Nino has been associated with drought in the Caribbean, onset of the 2015 drought was strongly associated with lower-than-average values of a recently developed tool used by weather forecasters in San Juan, the Galvez-Davison Index (GDI), which is used to measure the potential for thunderstorm development and rainfall. Persistently low GDI values indicate strong and frequent intrusions of hot, dry air in the low to middle troposphere, suppressing convection, both locally and in development regions for tropical waves that impact Puerto Rico. The Saharan Air Layer (SAL) is largely responsible for this anomalously hot, dry air, which produced thermodynamically stable conditions and limited thunderstorms and rainfall. Moreover, higher-than-normal aerosol concentrations, typically associated with SAL intrusion over the Caribbean, were recorded in April and May 2015. A comparison to advanced very high resolution radiometer aerosol optical thickness demonstrates that higher Caribbean aerosols in the early rainfall season, particularly June, are associated with decreased rainfall in eastern Puerto Rico. Results here demonstrate a direct link between the early and more pronounced SAL intrusions into the Caribbean and the suppression of the early rainfall season. More broadly, a reduction in the GDI and increase in the trade wind inversion was associated with reduced early season rainfall in the eastern Caribbean.\n",

    "Mental Illness in the Workplace: An Interdisciplinary Review and Organizational Research Agenda": "Given the prevalence of and consequences associated with mental illness in the workplace, we believe this review is both critical and timely for researchers and practitioners. This systematic review broadens the extant literature in both theoretical and practical ways in an effort to help lay a foundation for the organizational scholarship of employees with mental illness, a group that has traditionally been underrepresented in the management and industrial-organizational psychology literatures. After defining and conceptualizing mental illness as a social identity, we systematically review the existing empirical research on employees with mental illness across multiple fields of study. Using research that accounts for individual, other, and organizational perspectives, we present a model that outlines the performance, employment, career, and discriminatory outcomes that characterize the experiences of individuals with mental illness as well as individual and organizational strategies that moderate the relationship between having a mental illness and experiencing those outcomes. Together, this article provides a synthesis of what is known about employees with mental illness while also highlighting avenues for future scholarly attention.\n",
    "Social Workers and Agencies": "Social media are shaping and changing the way social workers interact with clients; therefore, it is important for social workers to think about their own personal and professional presence on social media. The focus of this chapter is to provide social workers with strategies and guidelines about how best to utilize social media in hopes of avoiding sexual misconduct violations. One of the key factors involved in preventing sexual misconduct issues on social media is a well-thought out and critically designed presence. In order to establish an agenda for appropriately integrating and utilizing social media, agencies are recommended to develop the following: goals, social media policy, and publically posted guidelines. With implementation of policies and guidelines, human service agencies can more effectively prevent allegations of sexual misconduct.\n",
    "Advancing Sex Positivity while Combating Sexual Misconduct": "Social work professionals are accountable to ethical standards and a code of conduct that were developed to protect clients from harm. As accusations of sexual misconduct by social work practitioners is possible, it is important that agencies and organizations decrease the amount of additional harm that may result from the reporting and investigative process. Unfortunately, some agencies engage in practices that hinder the reporting of sexual misconduct, such as: victim blaming, lack of transparency, and limited communication during the investigation. Within this chapter, the authors propose that social work professionals adopt a sex positive approach to managing and investigating reports of sexual misconduct by practitioners. According to the authors, a sex positive approach seeks to challenge agencies and organizations to treat such cases seriously while respecting the individuals involved and limiting the risk of further violating or isolating the complainant.\n",
    "Leader preference in Neoconocephalus ensiger katydids: a female preference for a nonheritable male trait": "Female preferences for males producing their calls just ahead of their neighbours, leader preferences, are common in acoustically communicating insects and anurans. While these preferences have been well studied, their evolutionary origins remain unclear. We tested whether females gain a fitness benefit by mating with leading males inNeoconocephalus ensigerkatydids. We mated leading and following males with random females and measured the number and quality ofF1, the number ofF2and the heritability of the preferred male trait. We found that females mating with leaders and followers did not differ in the number ofF1orF2offspring. Females mating with leading males had offspring that were in better condition than those mating with following males suggesting a benefit in the form of higher quality offspring. We found no evidence that the male trait, the production of leading calls, was heritable. This suggests that there is no genetic correlate for the production of leading calls and that the fitness benefit gained by females must be a direct benefit, potentially mediated by seminal proteins. The presence of benefits indicates that leader preference is adaptive inN. ensiger, which may explain the evolutionary origin of leader preference; further tests are required to determine whether fitness benefits can explain the phylogenetic distribution of leader preference inNeoconocephalus. The absence of heritability will prevent leader preference from becoming coupled with or exaggerating the male trait and prevent females from gaining a 'sexy-sons' benefit, weakening the overall selection for leader preference.\n",
    "Alanine d15N trophic fractionation in heterotrophic protists": "We evaluated differences in the15N isotopic enrichment factors of trophic amino acids (AA) for protistan (microzooplankton) and metazoan (mesozooplankton) consumers, testing the hypothesis that d15N of alanine (ala) increases in both consumer types, while glutamic acid (glu) enriches mainly in mesozooplankton. AA d15N values were measured for dinoflagellate and ciliate grazers and their respective algal prey (Oxyrrhis marina/Dunaliella tertiolectaandFavellasp./Heterocapsa triquetra) in four two-stage chemostat experiments, including treatments with different nitrogen : phosphorous nutrient ratios and light/dark recycling conditions. Propagation of AA15N enrichment to a metazoan consumer was also assessed in two- and three-stage chemostat experiments simulating simple \"classical\" (Calanus pacificusand the diatomThalassiosira weissflogii) and \"multivorous\" (C. pacificus,O. marina, andD. tertiolecta) food chains. We found small or negligible15N-enrichment of glu for both protistan grazers, while ala enrichment was consistently greater and similar to that in metazoan consumers. Ala and glu d15N values were both highly elevated inC. pacificusrelative to prey, and enrichment was higher with autotrophic diets. These laboratory results suggest that ala may be used as an alternate, accurate isotopic proxy for quantifying protistan contributions to trophic structure in aquatic systems.\n",
    "An Exploratory Study of the Effectiveness of Mobile Advertising": "This study examines factors related to the effectiveness of mobile advertising. Using a large data set with 115,899 records of ad tap-through from a mobile advertising company in China, the authors identify that the influencing factors for advertisement tap through are application type, mobile operators, scrolling frequency, and regional income level. They use a logit model to analyze how the probability of advertisement tap through is related to the identified factors. The results show that application type, mobile operators, scrolling frequency, and the regional income level are positively correlated with the likelihood whether users would tap on certain types of advertising. In addition, they use the Bayesian network model to estimate the conditional probability for a user to tap on an advertisement in an application after the user already taps on another advertisement in the same application. Based on the findings, the authors propose strategies for mobile advertisers to engage in effective and targeted mobile advertising.\n",
    "Stereotype content and social distancing from employees with mental illness: The moderating roles of gender and social dominance orientation": "Mental illness is increasingly prevalent among employees, but little is known about how these individuals are perceived at work. Using the stereotype content model as a framework, we investigated warmth and competence stereotypes associated with employees with anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Employees with these disorders were perceived to be low in warmth and competence, and stereotypes about individuals with anxiety were relatively more positive than those with depression or bipolar. This study also proposed and tested the extent to which stereotypes predicted work-related social distancing intentions. We found that two characteristics moderated this relationship: gender and social dominance orientation. We discuss practical and theoretical implications as they pertain to improving the experiences and well-being of employees with mental illness.\n",
    "Humor Use Moderates the Relation of Stressful Life Events With Psychological Distress": "Three studies examined humor and adjustment to stressful events. In Study 1, patients with fibromyalgia syndrome ( N = 22) reported on mental and physical adjustment, social interaction, and reappraisal of their illness. Dispositional humor was associated with reduced distress and fewer physical symptoms. Study 2 ( N = 109) examined undergraduates' reports of stressful events. Dispositional, self-enhancing, affiliative, and self-defeating humor showed direct effects on distress, which were mediated by social interaction and reappraisal. Moreover, dispositional and aggressive humor showed stress-buffering effects. Study 3 ( N = 105) examined undergraduates' adjustment to the September 11, 2001, attacks at 1 and 3 months postattack. At T1, affiliative humor showed a stress-buffering effect on distress. Social interaction mediated the relation of self-enhancing humor with reduced T1 distress, and mediated relations of aggressive and self-defeating humor with greater distress. Relations of T1 dispositional and self-defeating humor to changes in T2 distress were mediated by reappraisal.\n",
    "Analysing regional climate forcing on historical precipitation variability in Northeast Puerto Rico": "The tropical forests of northeast Puerto Rico (NE PR) and the Luquillo Mountains (LM) are a large repository for biodiversity and have an important role in regional biogeochemical processes. Precipitation is a key driver of the productivity of these sensitive ecosystems. This study analyses historical precipitation variability from 1985 to 2014 at El Verde Field Station (EVFS) at 380 m on the north facing slope of the LM. The primary objective of this study is to identify atmospheric states that lead to extreme wet/dry conditions at EVFS. This study also investigates how those wet/dry atmospheric states change over the study period through an epoch approach on annual and seasonal timescales.\n\nSelf-organizing maps (SOMs) are used to produce atmospheric states from ERA-Interim low-tropospheric moisture and circulation variables. These atmospheric states are downscaled to precipitation at the EVFS rain gauge. A probability density function of observed precipitation is calculated for each atmospheric state. Changes in node frequency, which is the number of days mapping to a particular node compared to the total number of days in the temporal period, are used to evaluate changes in wet/dry atmospheric states at EVFS.\n\nResults indicate that low-precipitation days at EVFS are associated with atmospheric states with high 1000-700 hPa bulk wind shear and decreased 700 hPa moisture. Wet days in the study region are associated with moist low-tropospheric environments with low wind shear. Our results indicate an increased frequency of dry season atmospheric states with lower 700 hPa moisture. Over the study period, the dry season has a decrease in median and extreme precipitation during rainy days (days >0 mm). A decrease in early rainfall season median precipitation on rainy days is observed despite an increase in days with measurable precipitation, likely driven by an increase in light rainfall days (<5 mm).\n",
    "To Share and Protect: Using Regulatory Focus Theory to Examine the Privacy Paradox of Consumers' Social Media Engagement and Online Privacy Protection Behaviors": "Consumers' personal information often informs retailers' marketing efforts in terms of creating value in the online marketplace. This study examines four factors related to consumers' social media engagement and online privacy protection behaviors. Regulatory focus, social exchange, and marketing relationship theories explain the online consumer personal information share-and-protect model developed. Consumers aged 18-64 years across the United States participated in this survey research. The results suggest that while personal privacy violation experience and perceived secondary control of one's personal information are influential antecedents, privacy concerns and trust in social media websites mediate each of these respectively. The findings suggest that promotion- and prevention-related behaviors regarding personal information align with the orientation of the antecedents, indicating that regulatory focus theory shows promise for examining the privacy paradox. We conclude by developing a matrix that integrates regulatory focus and social exchange theories to guide future research.\n",
    "Inferior olivary projection to the zebrin II stripes in lobule IXcd of the pigeon flocculus: A retrograde tracing study": "Zebrin II (ZII; a.k.a. aldolase C) is expressed heterogeneously in Purkinje cells (PCs) such that there are sagittal stripes of high expression (ZII+) interdigitated with stripes of little or no expression (ZII-). The pigeon flocculus receives visual-optokinetic information and is important for generating compensatory eye movements. It consists of 4 sagittal zones based on PC complex spike activity (CSA) in response to rotational optokinetic stimuli. There are two zones where CSA responds best to rotation about the vertical axis (VA), interdigitated with two zones where CSA responds best to rotation about an horizontal axis (HA). These optokinetic zones relate to the ZII stripes in folium IXcd of the flocculus, such that an optokinetic zone spans a ZII+/- pair: the HA zones span the P5+/- and P7+/- ZII stripe pairs, whereas the VA zones correspond to ZII stripe pairs P4+/- and P6+/-. In the present study, we used fluorescent retrograde tracing to determine the olivary inputs to the ZII+ and ZII- stripes within the functional pairs. We found that separate but adjacent areas of the medial column of the inferior olive (mcIO) project to the ZII+ and ZII- stripes within each of the functional pairs. Thus, although a ZII+/- stripe pair represents a functional unit in the pigeon flocculus insofar as the CSA of all PCs in the stripe pair encodes similar sensory information, the olivary inputs to the ZII+ and ZII- stripes arise from different, although adjacent, regions of the mcIO.\n",
    "The Effects of Expertise and Social Status on Team Member Influence and the Moderating Roles of Intragroup Conflicts": "Drawing on expectation states theory and expertise utilization literature, we examine the effects of team members' actual expertise and social status on the degree of influence they exert over team processes via perceived expertise. We also explore the conditions under which teams rely on perceived expertise versus social status in determining influence relationships in teams. To do so, we present a contingency model in which the salience of expertise and social status depends on the types of intragroup conflicts. Using multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams with 320 members at a large national research institute located in South Korea, we found that both actual expertise and social status had direct and indirect effects on member influence through perceived expertise. Furthermore, perceived expertise at the early stage of team projects is driven by social status, whereas perceived expertise at the later stage of a team project is mainly driven by actual expertise. Finally, we found that members who are being perceived as experts are more influential when task conflict is high or when relationship conflict is low. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.\n",
    "Challenges to advance care planning among multidisciplinary health professionals in China": "## Background:\nAdvance care planning (ACP) is a critical component of quality end-of-life care. Little is known regarding the cultural influences on health professionals' attitudes toward the discussion of ACP in China.\n\n## Objective:\nTo better understand attitudes toward ACP among Chinese healthcare professionals in China and the influence of cultural factors such as filial piety, or xiao.\n\n## Methods:\nA mixed methods study was used. This study reports the results of a descriptive cross-sectional survey of physicians, nurses and social workers with experience in palliative and end-of-life care.\n\n## Results:\nSome 102 completed surveys were obtained. Most Chinese health professionals had an overall positive attitude toward ACP, acknowledging that these discussions should occur. However, there was a general lack of confidence and sense of reluctance among participants to engage in ACP discussions.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThe lack of statistical difference between the various health professionals suggests that they all faced challenges in participating in ACP discussions. Future research should focus on the influences of cultural factors such as xiao on ACP discussion, and develop culturally sensitive strategies to facilitate these discussions in the Chinese community.\n",
    "Teaching Psychology and Climate Change": "The American Psychological Association (APA) has called for psychologists to become more involved in addressing climate change. One way to address this pressing issue is through curriculum. To this end, we describe an undergraduate course that we created and teach exclusively focused on the interface of psychology and global climate change. The course is a seminar structured around three broad themes: science and impacts, adaptation, and solutions. To support others developing curriculum in this area, we explain these themes and share the course organization and structure, along with our experiences in teaching it. We provide relevant examples of activities and resources in the context of the goals and outcomes of APA's \"Guidelines for the Undergraduate Psychology Major.\" We discuss considerations of competence and interdisciplinarity in teaching on this issue. Finally, given the magnitude and significance of climate change, we consider experiential aspects of students in the course related to stress.\n",
    "Natural Resource Dependency and Entrepreneurship: Are Nations with High Resource Rents Cursed?": "Testing the hypothesis that the resource curse promotes rent-seeking behaviour at the expense of entrepreneurship, we examine the relationship between natural resource rents and new business creation using a panel of 116 countries spanning the period 2001-2012. We find that nations with heavy natural resource extraction exhibit less entrepreneurial activity, but this negative relationship is greatly reduced and even reversed in nations possessing a threshold level of governance quality. Unfortunately, the group of nations exceeding this threshold consists primarily of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development members. These results support the hypothesis that the resource curse, when left unchecked by weak institutions, promotes rent-seeking behaviour that harms entrepreneurship.

    "The Effects of a High-Volume and High-Intensity Resistance Training Program on Arterial Stiffness": "Arterial stiffness has long been regarded as an indicator of disease and is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events. Controversies exist amongst the impact of resistance training protocols on the stiffening process in the major elastic arteries. This study was designed to address some of the controversies.\n\n## PURPOSE:\nTo determine the vascular impact of a high-volume (HV), moderate resistance training program and a high-intensity (HI), moderate repetition training program on arterial compliance.\n\n## METHODS:\n21 otherwise healthy, male university students with limited resistance training experience (< 6 months) were randomized into one of three groups: 7 control (CO) group (22+-3 yrs), 6 HI resistance exercise group (23+-3 yrs), and 8 HV resistance exercise group (21+-3 yrs). All were subjected to a series of tests including anthropometry, ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, blood pressure acquisition, and maximal strength assessment. Subjects were instructed to maintain normal dietary patterns throughout the study period. Food consumption was monitored. All subjects in the training groups performed the same 8-10 exercises on training days. Subjects in the HV group trained at 50-70% of 1-RM with 10-15 repetitions and 2-4 sets per exercise for 3-5 days a week for 12 weeks. Subjects in the HI group trained at 70-95% of 1-RM with 3-6 repetitions and 2-3 sets per exercise for 3-5 days a week for 12 weeks. Subjects randomized to the control group were instructed to refrain from both cardiovascular and resistance exercise during the study period. Arterial stiffness comparisons were calculated with two-way ANOVA with repeated measures.\n\n## RESULTS:\n1-RM significantly increased for squat (52% vs. 25%, p<0.05), bench press (31% vs. 27%, p<0.05) and seated rows (22% vs. 13%, p<0.05) in the HV and HI groups respectively. Carotid femoral PWV did not change in the HI (7.6+-2 vs. 8.1+-2 m/s, p>0.05), HV (6.3+-1 vs. 6.8+-2 m/s, p>0.05), and CO (6.7+-1 vs. 6.7+-1 m/s, p>0.05) groups. Beta stiffness index did not change in the HI (5.9+-3.5 vs. 5.7+-2.6 U, p>0.05), HV (6.5+-1.9 vs. 6.5+-2.1 U, p>0.05), and CO (7.2+-4.4 vs. 6.4+-3.1 m/s, p>0.05) groups.\n\n## CONCLUSION:\n12 weeks of HI and HV training does not appear to augment indices for arterial stiffness in young, adult males.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.

    "The PASCO Wireless Smart Cart: A Game Changer in the Undergraduate Physics Laboratory": "With the introduction of the Wireless Smart Cart by PASCO scientific in April 2016, we expect a paradigm shift in undergraduate physics laboratory instruction. We have evaluated the feasibility of using the smart cart by carrying out experiments that are usually performed using traditional PASCO equipment. The simplicity, convenience, and cost-saving achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional laboratory sensors, wires, and equipment clutter with the smart cart are reported here.\n",
    "Assessing the Effects of Inorganic Arsenic on IL-1b and TNFa Secretion, Gene Expression, and DNA Methylation in Murine Macrophages to Gauge Immunotoxic Effects of Heavy Metals": "Trivalent inorganic arsenic, arsenite, is a natural component of the earth and is often found in drinking water in areas where the composition is high. Some studies have suggested that, especially at moderate to high exposure levels, arsenite is toxic to individuals who are chronically exposed through drinking water, characterized by an increase in inflammatory cytokine release, specifically interleukin-1b (IL-1b) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNFa). Other epidemiological studies at low to moderate exposures did not find the same correlation with inflammation. We aim to characterize and quantify the effects of arsenite exposure to macrophages to gauge any potential inflammatory response.\n\nM1 macrophages are key players in inflammatory response and secrete IL-1b and TNFa in response to Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) released by neighboring cells undergoing necrosis, in coordination with Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs), molecules associated with pathogens, such as lipopolysaccharide, or LPS. We obtained a murine macrophage cell line to study the effects of arsenic on inflammatory cytokine secretionin vitro. A dose response curve was developed including varying concentrations of arsenite with and without 50 ng/mL LPS, using the same treatments without arsenite as controls. Cytolethality was determined by differential staining and counting. Secretion of cytokines after 24 hours of exposure was quantified using ELISA. Results were statistically analyzed using Student's t-test and One-Way ANOVA. IL-1b was not differentially secreted for any concentration of arsenite, but cytolethality and TNFa secretion were significantly increased for 200 nM arsenite with LPS as opposed to 200 nM arsenite without LPS, possibly indicating that some inflammatory augmentation occurs in the presence of both arsenite exposure and a PAMP.\n\nFuture steps include analyzing alterations in expression of genes responsible for proteins involved in the secretory pathways of these cytokines. For example, the genes involved in manufacturing the pieces of the NLRP3 inflammasome, key in production of IL-1b, or TNFa Converting Enzyme, involved in cleavage of the TNFa precursor, may be potential targets. Additionally, we will explore differential DNA methylation using methylation sensitive and insensitive restriction enzyme digestion to examine epigenetic control of cytokine secretion in response to arsenite. These results will be reported to appraise the immunotoxic effects of arsenic exposure.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nThis research is supported by the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences and the Salisbury University Honors College.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.

    "Shared core values of high performing employee-owned enterprises": "Values represent guidelines for behavior and are important determinants of organizational performance. In addition, employee-owned enterprises (EOEs) tend to outperform traditional organizations. Thus, identifying the core values that underlie successful EOEs should provide insights\n for improved firm performance. Based on an exploratory comparative analysis of eight high-performing, employee-owned companies, a common set of values that form the basis of their cultures was identified. At one level, four core foundational values - honesty, autonomy, empowerment, and\n egalitarianism - stood out as enhancing the work experience of individual employees. At another level, four organizational values - accountability, transparency, community, and sustainability - were evident. The identified values do overlap and may serve to support, reinforce,\n or initiate each other. Moreover, these firms appear to have built management practices and policies that bolster these values. Thus, knowledge of the practices, policies, and core values should be beneficial to organizations seeking high performance.\n",
    "Heterozygosity-behavior and heterozygosity-fitness correlations in a salamander with limited dispersal": "Inbreeding and genetic drift can decrease genetic heterozygosity, and this low heterozygosity can depress fitness, resulting in heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs). HFCs are typically small in magnitude, a result often attributed to power of the analyses. Animal behaviors often affect fitness and are often heritable to some degree. We hypothesized that heterozygosity influences behavior, which, in turn, potentially influences fitness. Specifically, in red-backed salamanders,Plethodon cinereus, which have limited dispersal and the potential for inbreeding, we tested whether heterozygosity, as estimated from six microsatellite loci, affected home range size, juvenile growth, and survival. We found that salamanders with higher heterozygosity had larger home ranges and grew faster, which is indicative of reproductive success. However, we found no effects of heterozygosity on survival. We conclude that, because activity inP. cinereusis tightly linked to food uptake and mass gain, heterozygosity influences growth via effects on foraging behavior. Future research should investigate how the relationship between heterozygosity, behavior, and fitness may be affected or mediated by endocrine or immune systems.\n",
    "Repeating Something Familiar": "Segments are a structured presentation style that is commonly used on late-night talk and variety television shows. Research has shown that shows that contain segments with both entertaining and informative content (e.g., The Daily Show) have increased students' political knowledge. This study investigated how the structure of segments could be adapted to present material in classroom lectures to promote recall of both learning events and course content. For the first two units in a three-unit child development course, students experienced segments along with traditional lecture activities. Although performance varied across measures, results indicated that segments are a useful teaching tool to promote retention of material and recall of learning events. The use of segments in other types of courses is discussed.\n",
    "State of knowledge: Four decades of victim-offender mediation research and practice: The evidence": "This paper provides an overview of 40 years of victim-offender mediation evaluation research. This research demonstrates that victims and offenders are more satisfied with the process and outcomes than with the courts, they are more likely to draft and complete restitution agreements, they derive psychosocial benefits, the process is less expensive, crime victims are more likely to receive apologies from offenders, and offenders are less likely to recidivate. These benefits are not necessarily uniformly distributed. This \"first wave\" research provides a platform for the second wave, currently underway. To contextualize these findings, current and future victim-offender mediation practices are outlined.\n",
    "Re-conceptualizing pain through patient-centred care in the complementary and alternative medicine therapeutic relationship": "## Aims:\nThe study aim was to understand the patient description of the therapeutic relationship with theirCAMprovider in the context of pain self-management.\n\n## Background:\nBecause pain is a subjective state, its assessment depends on patient perception of and response to pain. For nurses to provide empathetic and compassionate care, there is a need to explicate patient perceptions of the therapeutic relationship to (re)conceptualize models of patient-centred care.\n\n## Design:\nInductive qualitative content analysis of patient interviews was conducted to identify how patients described therapeutic relationship themes and understand self-management of pain.\n\n## Methods:\nParticipants were individuals working with aCAMpractitioner and solicited through purposive and snowball sampling in collaboration with the practitioners from the mid-Atlantic region of the United States in 2016 (N=13). Verbatim transcriptions of audio-recorded semi-structured in-depth interviews (430 single-spaced pages approximately) were content analysed.\n\n## Findings:\nPatients described the therapeutic relationship with the provider as a: (1) giver, who was \"in-tune\" with their sense of self to support self-affirmation through empathetic listening; and (2) guide, who connected the mind and body through their practice to support self-reflective learning.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThis description of theCAMtherapeutic relationship advances understandings of readjustment of patient relationship with pain through the provider's empathetic listening and connecting the mind and the body to support patient self-affirmation of pain experiences and self-reflective learning. The findings illuminate how a feminist standpoint contributes to understandings of the therapeutic relationship that centres patient subjectivity and co-construction of meaning-making processes to support self-management of pain.\n",
    "That was last time! The effect of a delay on children's episodic memories of learning new facts": "Accurately remembering how and when one's own learning occurs is an important metacognitive skill that matures during the early school years. In two studies, the impact of a delay on this ability was examined. In Study 1, 30 children in two age groups (4-year-olds and 5-year-olds) participated in two-staged learning events and were interviewed immediately after each event about the facts they had learned in the events and about how they had acquired them. Children in both age groups learned the facts, but had significant difficulty reporting on their own learning. In Study 2, 79 children in the same age range participated in one staged learning event and were given similar interviews as in Study 1, either immediately after the event or after a 2- to 3-day delay. Five-year-olds were more accurate in their memories of learning in the delay condition than in the immediate condition, but 4-year-olds showed no performance differences as a function of delay. Findings are interpreted in light of developmental literature on episodic memory, source monitoring, and memory binding.\n\n## Highlights:\nHow does a delay interval between impact children's ability to accurately recall episodic memories of their own learning?Children completed staged learning events. Four- and five-year-olds struggled to recall instances of learning immediately, but five-year-olds improved after a delay.Five-year-olds, but not four-year-olds, appear to benefit from a moderate delay when recalling learning episodes. This could be due to developments in other metacognitive skills.\n\nHow does a delay interval between impact children's ability to accurately recall episodic memories of their own learning?\n\nChildren completed staged learning events.

    "Computation tree measurement language (CTML)": "In this work, we present a formal language, CTML, to reason over probabilistic systems. CTML extends stochastic temporal logics in a way that it takes a real value as input and output a real value in the range of[0,), as opposed to 0/1 values as input and output, and it cannestreal values. This allows CTML to express a rich set of queries towards the unification of model checking and performance evaluation. In fact, CTML covers PCTL. It can express a nontrivial subset of PLTL formulas that cannot be expressed by PCTL. The significance of this result is that the overall complexity of CTML is linear, as opposed to exponential as it is with PLTL, in the size of the operators for a given formula, and polynomial in the size of a given model. Moreover, CTML can express real-valued performance queries such as: \"if a system encounters a failure, what is the expected time to reach a recovery state?\" that cannot be expressed by a probabilistic model checking logic, because they are \"probabilistic\" at most. Along with the specification language, we present a set of algorithms for the evaluation of the language and show proofs for their correctness. Additionally, we include an application example and show experimental results.\n",
    "Justice, subalternism, and literary justice: Aravind Adiga's The White Tiger": "This article analyses Aravind Adiga's Booker prize-winning novel The White Tiger (2008) through the lens of justice: philosophical, legal, and literary. What is justice when its agent is subaltern -- disprivileged by both caste and class -- and delivers justice to himself? I argue that the fictional representation of class, caste, poverty, and violence can be similar to the structuring and translations of justice. By writing his novel from the perspective of a subaltern character, Adiga joins the call by Dalit critics to reconfigure modernity from the interests of the oppressed and the marginalized. In the process, there can be a rethinking of postcolonial literary criticism from within the postcolonial nation, rather than the established perspective of the postcolonial nation understanding its own colonial oppression. My essay provokes wider insights into the implications for justice and human rights as they are informed and represented by literary fiction, subaltern theory, and deconstructive theory. How can a writer conceive of and represent justice -- literary justice -- by working within and against philosophical and legal conceptions of justice? The philosophers and theorists I invoke include Drucilla Cornell, Jacques Derrida, Wai Chee Dimock, Emmanuel Levinas, Gayatri Chakravarty Spivak, and Robert Young.\n",
    "Writing the village, becoming the nation: The work of Manoj Das": "Manoj Das is a leading senior writer within Indian literature, with his novels, short stories, and poems centring on village and rural life, mingling realism and everyday experiences with elements of mystery, mysticism, and the supernatural as he explores the vicissitudes and aspirations of the human condition. As he describes here, Das has been \"greatly influenced\" by the transition and transformation of India from colonialism to postcolonialism. His writings -- with dramatic suspense, magical realism, and a style that with a minimal touch can convey nuances of character, motivation, and emotion -- evocatively capture some of the most distinctive aspects of Indian culture, spirituality, arts, and history. His work has been compared with other famed Indian authors, particularly those writing in English (Mulk Raj Anand, R. K. Narayan, Raja Rao). In this interview, Das reflects on his life work, including the role of translation (in an Indian context of \"transcreation\"). Das also shares his candid views on the poetics and politics of \"regional language literature\" (RLL) and \"Indian writing in English\" (IWE), an opposition relevant to postcolonial studies in the context of the (national and international) distribution and reception of literature and the wider politics of language. Conducted in the southern Indian city of Puducherry, home to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, this interview presents the influence of philosopher and guru Sri Aurobindo on Das and his work, including Das's most recent scholarship on Sri Aurobindo. Das also discusses the influences on him by the well-known Indian writers Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, Fakir Mohan Senapati, and Rabindranath Tagore. This is the first interview with Das published outside of India and in the West.\n",
    "To Lead Is to Err: The Mediating Role of Attribution in the Relationship Between Leader Error and Leader Ratings": "The purpose of this study was threefold: to expand the existing leader error taxonomy to include a third dimension of leader error (i.e., ethical errors), to examine the differential effects of error type on leader ratings, and to test a mediated model in which behavioral attribution mediated the relationship between error type and leader ratings. Results showed that ethical errors were distinct from previously established dimensions. Ethical and relationship errors resulted in lower ratings of leader liking and willingness to follow the leader, as compared to task errors. In addition to showing how error types differentially affected leader ratings, this study provided evidence for how this relationship is transmitted. Across two mediation models, behavioral attribution mediated the relationship between leader error and leader ratings after an error occurred. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed as well as future directions for research.\n",

    "The Effect of Individual and Pooled Profit Sharing Plans on Honesty in Managerial Reporting": "Many organizations offer profit sharing plans to motivate increased effort and goal congruence. However, an unintended consequence of such plans may be to reduce honesty in managerial reporting. We investigate two commonly observed profit sharing plans (individual and pooled) in a laboratory experiment where multiple agents with private cost information submit budget requests to an employer. Consistent with our prediction based on crowding theory, our findings suggest that honesty is reduced in the presence of an individual profit sharing plan. However, when a pooled profit sharing plan is used, the adverse effects on honesty are partially mitigated. Our results suggest that an unintended consequence of profit sharing (decreased honesty) can be mitigated through interdependency from pooled plans. The results have practical implications, given that organizations have flexibility in establishing both the size and scope of their profit sharing plans. Our study also contributes to our understanding of reporting behavior, particularly in multi-agent settings.\n",
    "Making civic engagement go viral: Applying social epidemiology principles to civic education": "This paper explores the connections between education for youth civic engagement and theories and strategies from public health (specifically, epidemiology). We illustrate this with four applications of epidemiologic theory to youth civic engagement: social determinants and fundamental causes, vulnerable populations and cumulative disadvantage, positive spillover, and herd immunity and critical mass. Formalizing concepts of current civics, in schools and the public, as a civic epidemic, we present a case for individual- and group-level interventions based around targeted, school-based, effective civic education initiatives. Grounded in epidemiological theory, such approaches call attention to the simultaneous need to improve broad civics education and ensure that particular populations receive necessary attentions.\n",
    "Relative Importance of Major Job Performance Dimensions in Determining Supervisors' Overall Job Performance Ratings": "This study explores the factor structure of job performance and each performance dimension's relative importance in determining supervisors' overall job performance ratings. We found that the optimal factor structure of job performance includes five dimensions: task performance, organizational citizenship behaviour directed toward the organization and individuals (OCB-O and OCB-I, respectively), and counterproductive work behaviour directed toward the organization and individuals (CWB-O and CWB-I, respectively). The percent-based relative weight (%RW) is the highest for task performance in determining job performance, followed by OCB and CWB. Interestingly, the %RW of non-task performance dimensions directed toward the organization (OCB-O and CWB-O) is similar to the %RW of task performance but greater than the %RW of non-task performance dimensions directed toward individuals (OCB-I and CWB-I).

    "Transcriptional Fusions of Putative G-protein Coupled-Receptors from Hookworm (Ancylostoma ceylanicum) Expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans": "Many parasites, including hookworms of the genusAncylostoma, are specialists and require host-specific signals to resume development upon infection. Although little is known about the nature of these signaling molecules, evolutionary conservation between hookworms and the model nematodeC. eleganssuggests that hookworm host-signal receptors are likely to be G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are expressed in amphid neurons. Based on bioinformatic analysis of developmental stage-specific RNA-Seq data fromA. caninumandA. ceylanicum, predicted hookworm GPCRs with increased expression levels during the infective larval stage 3 (iL3) were identified.\n\nApproximately 1500 bp of genomic sequence upstream of the predicted start site for the putativeA. ceylanicumGPCRs were fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence to generate promoter-GFP transcriptional fusion constructs, which were microinjected intoC. elegans. Of nine hookworm promoter fusions tested, four drove differential GFP expression inC. eleganstissues, including the digestive tract, pharynx, and a neuron pair. Preliminary analysis identified the neurons as interneurons, potentially involved in locomotion responses to chemosensory input inC. elegans. The putative GPCR encoded by the neuronally expressed gene is upregulated in bothA. ceylanicumandA. caninum, suggesting that it may play a general role in hookworm development during host infection. These experiments indicate that hookworm promoters can be expressed inC. elegans, providing a surrogate system for the study of hookworm gene expression patterns.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2018 Meeting.

    "Rural School-Based Mental Health Services: Parent Perceptions of Needs and Barriers": "The benefits of school-based mental health services have been supported in prior research and literature. Studies have shown that approximately one in five youths in schools today have diagnosable mental health disorders. However, research has identified that close to 70 percent of those youths do not receive the services they need. This gap in care has a significant impact on the academic, social, and emotional well-being of youths. Parent involvement is essential in bridging services. However, parents often face barriers in accessing mental health care for their child. The aim of this study was to explore parent perceptions of needs and barriers to school-based mental health services. This exploratory study included 607 parent and guardian respondents. Findings showed that parents were overwhelmingly in support of schools being involved in addressing the mental health needs of students. Anxiety, depression, and bullying were the top emotional and behavioral issues that parents recognized as the main challenge for their child. Lack of parent support, understanding that mental health issues even exist in youths, and lack of supportive school programs were identified as key factors that place youths at risk of not receiving the services they need.\n",
    "Mobile (Dis)connection: New Technology and Rechronotopized Images of the Homeland": "This paper focuses on how information accessed through new media is discursively represented by migrants. Taking an ethnographic approach to the analysis of Uzbek and Iranian migration discourse, we show how the underspecified and decontextualized information received via technology is combined with the \"imagined homeland\" in order toreconstructimages of lifethere-and-now. Since images of the homeland are chronotopic in nature, we argue that the reconstruction of these images can be understood asrechronotopization. The rechronotopized image, then, operates as a lens through which migrants socially position themselves relative to the homeland. More specifically, we show how the conflict between prior images and rechronotopized images are invoked to construct difference and discuss disconnection. Thus, while technology facilitates connection, we argue that because it reminds migrants of how things have changed since they left, it may also lead to feelings of disconnection.\n",
    "What Matters Most at the End-of-Life for Chinese Americans?": "Background: To provide optimal end-of-life (EOL) care in the Chinese American population, we need to have a better understanding of what matters most at EOL from their perspective. Experiencing a \"good death\" at the EOL is the optimal goal of palliative care. Studies show that the meaning and description of good death varies across cultures in different populations. In the United States, Chinese Americans comprise the largest Asian demographic. Aim: To describe EOL wishes, which define a good death for Chinese Americans. Method: Qualitative study using focus groups. A convenience sample of 60 Chinese Americans was recruited from a community organization in Maryland. Ten focus group discussion sessions were conducted. Results: Wishes at the EOL that defined a good death for the participants in this study included being pain-free, not being a burden to family, being with family, having a trusted physician, maintaining dignity, and prayer. Conclusion: A good death is a complex concept. What matters most to patients at the EOL differs depending on their cultural background. When caring for Chinese Americans, a comprehensive EOL care plan should include cultural considerations in addition to physical, psychosocial, and spiritual needs.\n",
    "Action civics education and civic outcomes for urban youth: An evaluation of the impact of Generation Citizen": "In action civics education, an emerging promising practice, students learn civics through taking action on a community issue of interest. We examine the action civics programme Generation Citizen (GC) using quantitative and qualitative student survey data. Our quantitative analyses used a quasi-experimental study design and a multilevel model. Participation in GC was associated with increased action civics knowledge, and there were some variations in impact by programme and classroom characteristics. We also qualitatively analysed students' short reflections upon programme completion and found that students feel more prepared for civic action. Action civics shows promise for improving student civic outcomes, but more research, including longitudinal follow-up, is needed. Given the variations in impact that we observed, action civics practitioners should carefully choose the implementation setting.\n",
    "Uncivil Twitter": "Using four tweets by Steven Salaita about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that resulted in the retraction of his academic job offer in September 2014 as our case study, we investigate the role of Twitter in the shaping and reception of the controversial messages. Our analysis combines Gricean pragmatics with im/politeness and hate-speech research to reveal a complex layering of potential meanings stemming from what is linguistically encoded in each tweet. Their construal as hate speech, in particular, depends on which of these potential meanings critics chose to focus upon. We account for this finding by considering the diversity of potential audiences of a tweet and suggest that the effects of context collapse on implicated meanings can be especially detrimental. Competition for attention among incoming tweets, Twitter's central affiliative function and applicable length restrictions can, nevertheless, place a premium on communicating such meanings.\n",
    "Disruption of peripheral nerve development in a zebrafish model of hyperglycemia": "Diabetes mellitus-induced hyperglycemia is associated with a number of pathologies such as retinopathy, nephropathy, delayed wound healing, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Approximately 50% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop DPN, which is characterized by disrupted sensory and/or motor functioning, with treatment limited to pain management. Zebrafish ( Danio rerio) are an emerging animal model used to study a number of metabolic disorders, including diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy, nephropathy, and delayed wound healing have all been demonstrated in zebrafish. Recently, our laboratory has demonstrated that following the ablation of the insulin-producing b-cells of the pancreas (and subsequent hyperglycemia), the peripheral nerves begin to show signs of dysregulation. In this study, we take a different approach, taking advantage of the transdermal absorption abilities of zebrafish larvae to extend the period of hyperglycemia. Following 5 days of 60 mM d-glucose treatment, we observed motor axon defasciculation, disturbances in perineurial glia sheath formation, decreased myelination of motor axons, and sensory neuron mislocalization. This study extends our understanding of the structural changes of the peripheral nerve following induction of hyperglycemia and does so in an animal model capable of potential DPN drug discovery in the future.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHY Zebrafish are emerging as a robust model system for the study of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and impaired wound healing. We present a novel model of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in zebrafish in which the integrity of the peripheral nerve is dysregulated following the induction of hyperglycemia. By using this model, future studies can focus on elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms currently unknown.\n",
    "Acute effects of hyperglycemia on the peripheral nervous system in zebrafish (Danio rerio) following nitroreductase-mediated b-cell ablation": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is estimated to affect 50% of diabetic patients. Although DPN is highly prevalent, molecular mechanisms remain unknown and treatment is limited to pain relief and glycemic control. We provide a novel model of acute DPN in zebrafish ( Danio rerio) larvae. Beginning 5 days postfertilization (dpf), zebrafish expressing nitroreductase in their pancreatic b-cells were treated with metronidazole (MTZ) for 48 h and checked for b-cell ablation 7 dpf. In experimental design, this was meant to serve as proof of concept that b-cell ablation and hyperglycemia are possible at this time point, but we were surprised to find changes in both sensory and motor nerve components. Compared with controls, neurod+sensory neurons were often observed outside the dorsal root ganglia in MTZ-treated fish. Fewer motor nerves were properly ensheathed by nkx2.2a+perineurial cells, and tight junctions were disrupted along the motor nerve in MTZ-treated fish compared with controls. Not surprisingly, the motor axons of the MTZ-treated group were defasciculated compared with the control group, myelination was attenuated, and there was a subtle difference in Schwann cell number between the MTZ-treated and control group. All structural changes occurred in the absence of behavioral changes in the larvae at this time point, suggesting that peripheral nerves are influenced by acute hyperglycemia before becoming symptomatic. Moving forward, this novel animal model of DPN will allow us to access the molecular mechanisms associated with the acute changes in the hyperglycemic peripheral nervous system, which may help direct therapeutic approaches.\n",
    "Translational Fusion of a G-protein Coupled-Receptor from the Hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum Expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans": "Hookworms are infectious parasites that affect more than 500 million people worldwide, causing extensive morbidity and economic burden in developing countries. Mass drug administration is a current control method, but resistance is of concern. Many hookworm species, including those in the genusAncylostoma, are specialists and require specific host signals to continue development upon infection. Little is known about the signaling mechanisms, although evolutionary conservation between parasitic nematodes and the model organismC. eleganssuggests that G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in amphid neurons are chemosensory detection candidates. The amphid neurons ofC. elegansare exposed to the environment, even during the dauer stage, an alternate phase of larval development that is similar to the parasitic infective juvenile stage. Previous experiments involvingA. ceylanicumtranscriptional GFP fusions inC. elegansidentified putative GPCR genes expressed in neurons during dauer stage. To confirm that hookworm proteins are neuronally localized under dauer conditions, a translational GFP fusion of a putative hookworm GPCR was generated. The entire coding sequence, plus introns, was cloned using homologous recombination-based, yeast assembly methods to create a C-terminal GFP fusion. The putativeA. ceylanicumpromoter consisted of the upstream intergenic region, which is approximately 5000 base pairs, and the transcriptional terminator fromC. elegans unc-54was used. To generate the expression plasmid, amplicons containing homology to the adjacent segment in the assembly were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and transformed into yeast. The plasmid was verified by junction-confirming PCR analysis, restriction enzyme mapping, and sequencing. After microinjection, GFP expression in amphid neurons of stably transformedC. elegansduring the dauer stage would support the hypothesis that this putative GPCR plays a role in reception of host signaling molecules and may provide a possible therapeutic target.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nThis work was supported by the Salisbury University Faculty Mini-Grant Program.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

    "Eliciting Differentiation of Human T Lymphocytes into TH1 or TH2 cells with Inorganic Arsenic Exposure": "A naturally-occurring element, inorganic arsenic is found around the world in soil. It can contaminate fresh groundwater, where it is at risk of being ingested. Currently, arsenic is considered to be dangerous with chronic exposure and ingestion at 10 ug/L as established by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Chronic exposure to arsenic is associated with inflammation, but current studies have show that even at lower doses, there is a link to expression and secretion changes of cytokines within T lymphocytes, particularly with IL-2 for growth, pro-inflammatory IFN-g and anti-inflammatory IL-4. Shifts favoring pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines can lead to differentiation into TH1 or TH2 cells, which specialize in their immune response. In this study, we aim to investigate how the expression and secretion of these cytokines produced by activated T lymphocytes change as an in-vitro model of an activated human regulatory immune system. Through our model, we will detect if chronic low level arsenic exposure has the potential to catalyze a change in T lymphocyte function, and therefore overall immune function.\n\nPrevious studies have utilized various conditions by which to activate and treat T lymphocytes. As a result, there is variation in how these cytokines are predicted to change. For this study, we obtained human T lymphocytes. They were treated over 24 hours with 10 ng/mL of phytohemagglutinin, a known immune activator, and different concentrations of arsenic to develop a dose response curve, from 20 nM to 500 nM. Viable concentration and cytolethality were determined with differential staining and counting. Cell concentration and cytolethality changes were examined with one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni's Pairwise T-test. At 50 nM there is a difference in the cytolethality of the cells in the groups treated with arsenic with or without PHA with p < 0.05.\n\nFuture work will include ELISA assays will be performed on all treatment groups of the cell media collected for IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-g, followed by gene expression analysis via PCR. Experiments at 50 nM will be repeated as well to verify differences in cytolethality that were identified. Additionally, differential time periods for treatments of arsenic and PHA will be used to more accurately model chronic exposure in the cells. These other time points will analyzed through ELISA and gene expression analyses to inform the model of long-term change within the cells of the cytokine profiles.\n\nSupport or Funding Information\n\nThis research is supported by the Salisbury University Department of Biological Sciences, the Salisbury University Honors College, and the Salisbury University Henson School of Science Grant.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

    "A Novel Way to Use Vitamin C? Characterizing L-Ascorbate (Vitamin C) Catabolism in Ralstonia eutropha": "L-Ascorbate (Vitamin C) is present in the environment in plant tissues, typically at concentrations from 1-10mM, and as high as 300mM. L-Ascorbate is also an essential radical scavenger (antioxidant) for plants and mammals and is not synthesized by bacteria. Given the ubiquity of L-ascorbate in the environment, metabolism of L-ascorbate necessarily contributes to ecological recycling.Ralstonia eutrophaH16, a soil bacterium commonly studied for its versatile use of organic and inorganic carbon sources, can use L-ascorbate as a carbon source via an unknown pathway. Using RNAseq, whole cell transcript levels inR. eutrophawere compared between L-ascorbate-grown cells and succinate-or fructose-grown cells (controls). Putative pathway genes were identified by their increase in expression greater than 50-fold inR. eutrophagrown with L-ascorbate. Mutant strains (lacking putative pathway genes) were generated by homologous recombination directed allelic exchange. Wild type and mutant strains were grown in liquid cultures with either L-ascorbate or succinate as their sole carbon source and monitored by optical density to observe the phenotypic result of gene deletion. Growth studies have been performed, and L-ascorbate no growth phenotype has been confirmed for three mutant strains. Collaborators have characterized putative pathway enzymes. Characterizing the proposed catabolic pathway of L-ascorbate inR. eutrophawill provide information regarding environmental nutrient cycling and contribute novel functions of suspected pathway enzymes to protein databases.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

    "Authoring Selves in School: Adolescent Writing Identity": "This embedded case study investigates the nature of authorship in a secondary English Language Arts classroom by examining two adolescents' writing identities and experiences writing across genres. Using rhetorical genre theory, the study illustrates how composition and notions of authorship in this context were strongly informed by conversations--both with peers and the teacher. An additional finding was that students wrote themselves into different genre identities as they composed poetry, editorials, and memoirs, drawing on different authorial stances and sources of knowledge. Finally, this analysis documents robust learning about the nature of writing, including transferring rhetorical strategies across contexts and purposes, skills often called for in education policy as well as career and college writing, not documented in secondary schools. Implications for teaching include valuing relationship-building conversations, offering students multiple genre positions across secondary writing experiences, and considering ways to build upon writers' self-described and socially constructed identities as successful writers.\n",
    "DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY HONORS COURSE ON AGING": "With the aging of Baby Boomers, 2030 will mark the first time in U.S. history that those aged 65 and older will outnumber children. This population shift is expected to place unprecedented demands on the healthcare system in terms of both volume and complexity of care. Given these population shifts and emphasis on an interdisciplinary approach to care, a 4-credit Honors aging course was developed for Honors students in nursing and other health-related majors. Aging Reexamined, Reimagined is offered in a discussion/seminar format with limited enrollment to allow for deep reflective discourse about pertinent issues affecting older adults. Topics include physical/cognitive changes, ageism, Alzheimer's disease, sexuality, aging in place, polypharmacy, addiction, depression, caregiving, elder justice, and end-of-life care. Guest speakers share their expertise on selected issues, otherwise students alternate leading discussions on remaining topics. There are three focused reflections on assigned experiences which include conducting a videotaped interview with a retired community-based older adult, attending a support group or senior center activity, and visiting a center to view various physical/technological adaptive aids that maintain mobility and independence in the home. There is also a culminating research paper on an issue of their choice. Student evaluations are overwhelmingly positive; comments include gaining in-depth knowledge about the unique needs of this population and the importance of healthy aging with an emphasis on a positive, inter-professional approach to care. It is incumbent upon educators to better prepare students to recognize ageist attitudes, as well as address the significant impact of this \"longevity revolution\".\n",
    "Predicting College Women's Body-Esteem and Self-Esteem Based on Rape Experience, Recency, and Labeling": "We examined body-esteem and self-esteem based on rape experience, rape labeling status (yes; no) and recency of rape (recently, within past year; earlier, between age 14 and the past year). Undergraduate women ( n = 1,005) completed the Body-Esteem Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and Sexual Experiences Survey. Women raped within the past year (recently) reported lower levels of both body-esteem and self-esteem than those raped over a year ago (earlier) and nonvictims, but women raped earlier did not differ from nonvictims. Rape labeling status was not significant. Findings identify lower body-esteem, in addition to lower self-esteem, as correlates of recent rape.\n",
    "How to Improve Written Case Analysis and Reduce Grading Time: The One-Page, Two-Case Method": "Teaching with cases, especially at universities where cases are not a regular part of the curriculum, poses challenges for both faculty and students. The results in this research present an effective and manageable method to introduce the case analysis process and to facilitate written case analysis for both students and faculty. Experiment 1 compares the effectiveness of a semistructured one-page written case analysis over a traditional case analysis and finds the shorter assignment results in shorter grading time and better student grades. A two-case method introducing the case analysis process is tested in Experiment 2 and finds that a short lecture introducing the case analysis method and an initial small group practice case further improves student grades. Theoretical reasoning and directions for future research are discussed.\n",
    "Patient Communication of Chronic Pain in the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Therapeutic Relationship": "## Background:\nPatient descriptions of pain shape the pain experience, yet there is insufficient understanding of how patient communication can help providers lessen pain's psychological and physical impact.\n\n## Objective:\nTo examine how individuals communicate their pain experience in the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) provider-patient relationship.\n\n## Method:\nQualitative thematic framing examining semistructured interviews of a purposive and snowball sample of CAM patients (N = 13; 850 double-spaced pages) recruited from the mid-Atlantic region of the United States.\n\n## Results:\nComplementary and alternative medicine patients communicate the pain experience through an awareness of their interdependence with: (a) relational spaces as attention to the self, the healing practices, and the provider; (b) physical spaces as openness to surroundings and the spatiality and temporality of self; and (c) physiological spaces as breathing and neurological and immune system functioning.\n\n## Conclusion:\nA therapeutic relationship cultivating interdependence through awareness of relational, physical, and physiological spaces supports patients' ability to open up to, know, and accept their body. The CAM provider's work connects their practice with patient awareness of control over their environment, relationships, and physiology to redefine their pain experience.\n",
    "Software Vulnerability and Application Security Risk": "This research investigates the software vendor-based relationships between software vulnerability and application security risk. The data is obtained from the China National Vulnerability Database of Information Security (CNNVD). At first, we use the latent class model to classify the software vendors into three categories, and then employ regression models to estimate relationships between software vulnerability and application security risk for each of the three categories of the software vendors. The results show the relationships vary across the software vendors. The findings suggest that an IT vendor should learn specific vulnerability features according to its type to effectively avoid vulnerability generation on their products.\n",
    "Density-dependent fitness, not dispersal movements, drives temporal variation in spatial genetic structure in dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis)": "Some studies have found that dispersal rates and distances increase with density, indicating that density-dependent dispersal likely affects spatial genetic structure. In an 11-year mark-recapture study on a passerine, the dark-eyed junco, we tested whether density affected dispersal distance and/or fine-scale spatial genetic structure. Contrary to expectations, we found no effect of predispersal density on dispersal distance or the proportion of locally produced juveniles returning to the population from which they hatched. However, even though density did not affect dispersal distance or natal return rates, we found that density still did affect spatial genetic structure. We found significant positive spatial genetic structure at low densities of (postdispersal) adults but not at high densities. In years with high postdispersal (adult) densities that also had high predispersal (juvenile) densities in the previous year, we found negative spatial genetic structure, indicating high levels of dispersal. We found that density also affected fitness of recruits, and fitness of immigrants, potentially linking these population parameters with the spatial genetic structure detected. Immigrants and recruits rarely nested in low postdispersal density years. In contrast, in years with high postdispersal density, recruits were common and immigrants had equal success to local birds, so novel genotypes diluted the gene pool and effectively eliminated positive spatial genetic structure. In relation to fine-scale spatial genetic structure, fitness of immigrants and new recruits is poorly understood compared to dispersal movements, but we conclude that it can have implications for the spatial distribution of genotypes in populations.\n",
    "IT Application Maturity, Management Institutional Capability and Process Management Capability": "This article studies the influence of enterprise core competence on IT application maturity (ITAM) from the perspectives of management institutional and process management capabilities. The roles of firm ownership and international organization of standard (ISO) certifications are also studied. Based on reliable and valid measurements of IT applications maturity, management institutional capability, and process management capability, the authors collect corresponding data from 123 companies in China. They find a positive relationship between capabilities and ITAM. Management institutional capability has a stronger relationship with ITAM in Chinese state-owned enterprises or public companies; while multinational companies or joint ventures witness a stronger relationship with process management capability. ISO helps companies with low management institutional capability to improve ITAM. However, for companies with higher management institutional capability, ISO mitigates the relationship and poses a shift of the importance to process management capability in improving ITAM.\n",
    "RISING FROM THE FLOOR IN PERSONS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE": "While considerable research has targeted gait, balance and preventing falls in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD), less in known about the ability to rise from the floor in this population. The aims of this study were to 1) Examine the relationship between locomotion and physical performance tests and the timed supine to stand performance measure and to 2) Identify both the time required and predominant motor patterns utilized by persons with PD to complete to floor rise transition. A cross-sectional design was utilized. Twenty community-dwelling older adults with PD (mean age 74.8+/-9.5 years; 13 men) performed a standardized floor rise test and locomotion tests in a structured task circuit. Subject demographic and anthropometric data were also collected. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and Pearson Product Moment correlations. Fifteen subjects (75%) demonstrated the crouch kneel pattern and fourteen (70%) used an all-4's strategy to rise to stand. The mean time to rise from the floor was 14.9 (+/- 7.6) seconds and slower than published norms for persons without PD. Nine subjects required the use of a chair to perform floor recovery. Supine to stand performance time was significantly correlated with the: Dynamic Gait Index (r= - 0.66; p&lt;0.002), Five Times Sit to Stand Test (r=0.78; p&lt;0.001), Timed Up and Go Test (r=0.74; p&lt;0.001), and gait velocity (r= -0.77; p&lt;0.001). Rising from the floor demonstrates concurrent validity with locomotion and physical performance tests. Floor recovery techniques can be incorporated in fall prevention initiatives in conjunction with PD symptom management.\n",
    "Exploring the Relationship between Teacher Knowledge and Active-Learning Implementation in Large College Biology Courses": "Not all instructors implement active-learning strategies in a way that maximizes student outcomes. One potential explanation for variation in active-learning effectiveness is variation in the teaching knowledge an instructor draws upon. Guided by theoretical frameworks of pedagogical content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge, this study investigated the teaching knowledge instructors used in planning, implementing, and reflecting on active-learning lessons in large courses. We used a preinstruction interview, video footage of a target class session, and a postinstruction interview with stimulated recall to elicit the teaching knowledge participants used. We then conducted qualitative content analysis to describe and contrast teaching knowledge employed by instructors implementing active learning that required students to generate their own understandings (i.e., generative instruction) and active learning largely focused on activity and recall (i.e., active instruction). Participants engaging in generative instruction exhibited teaching knowledge distinct from that of participants focused on activity. Those using generative instruction drew on pedagogical knowledge to design lessons focused on students generating reasoning; integrated pedagogical content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge to plan lessons to target student difficulties; and created opportunities to develop new pedagogical content knowledge while teaching. This work generated hypotheses about the teaching knowledge necessary for effective, generative active-learning instruction.\n",
    "The postembryonic transformation of the shell in emydine box turtles": "A key trend in the 210-million-year-old history of modern turtles was the evolution of shell kinesis, that is, shell movement during neck and limb retraction. Kinesis is hypothesized to enhance predator defense in small terrestrial and semiaquatic turtles and has evolved multiple times since the early Cretaceous. This complex phenotype is nonfunctional and far from fully differentiated following embryogenesis. Instead, kinesis develops slowly in juveniles, providing a unique opportunity to illustrate the postembryonic origins of an adaptive trait. To this end, we examined ventral shell (plastral) kinesis in emydine box turtles and found that hatchling plastron shape differs from that of akinetic-shelled relatives, particularly where the hinge that enables kinesis differentiates. We also demonstrated shape changes relative to plastron size in juveniles, coinciding with a shift in the carapace-plastron structural connection, rearrangement of ectodermal plates, and bone repatterning. Furthermore, because the shell grows larger relative to the head, complete concealment of the head and extremities is only achieved after relative shell proportions increase. Structural alterations that facilitate the box turtle's transformation are probably prepatterned in embryos but require function-induced changes to differentiate in juveniles. This mode of delayed trait differentiation is essential to phenotypic diversification in turtles and perhaps other tetrapods.\n",
    "\"Authorized to work in the US\": Examining the myth of porous borders in the era of populism for practicing linguists": "This paper explores top-down, enacted, institutional pushbacks to supermobility and superdiversity in the under-examined arena of academia using emerging frameworks in political economy and the geography of mobility. Zooming in on the discoursal framings of a recent year of job advertisements on a popular, open-source forum for linguists supplemented with qualitatively and quantitatively sourced data from international, national, and local institutional contexts, the paper examines how macrocontextual pushes toward political populism combined with a synchronous tightening of job markets in academia have enacted a plethora of labels for temporary work in lieu of permanent academic positions--now, increasingly the only option for job seekers in a hypercompetitive academic market. In this manufacturing of euphemization discourse, we witness the invention of novel, microlinguistically rendered lexicalizations of semiotic redundancy in academic capitalism's own obfuscation of profit margins, and a concomitant manufacturing of a new discourse of rationality in which floating semiotic signifiers at multiple scales deploy nationality-criteria to justify ethnic exclusion and/or entry into academic space. More crucially, in these commonsensical framings, we encounter both causation and consequence of newly enacted barriers to transnational mobility. In challenging the myth of porous borders for mobile professionals in the post-global moment, these emerging linguistic signifiers point to the ascendancy of a new public affectivity on display in intellectual spheres and a saturation of sentiment toward illiberality.\n",
    "An Empirical Study of the Relationship between Seasonal Precipitation and Thermodynamic Environment in Puerto Rico": "With limited groundwater reserves and few reservoirs, Caribbean islands such as Puerto Rico are largely dependent on regular rainfall to meet societal and ecological water needs. Thus, the ability to anticipate seasonal rainfall shortages, such as the 2015 drought, is particularly important, yet few reliable tools exist for this purpose. Consequently, interpolated surface precipitation observations from the Daymet archive are summarized on daily, annual, and seasonal time scales and compared to the host thermodynamic environment as characterized by the Galvez-Davison index (GDI), a convective potential parameter designed specifically for the tropics. Complementing the Daymet precipitation totals, >=1.1 million WSR-88D volume scans between 2002 and 2016 were analyzed for echo tops >= 10 000 ft (~3 km) to establish a radar-inferred precipitation activity database for Puerto Rico. The 15-yr record reveals that the GDI outperforms several midlatitude-centric thermodynamic indices, explaining roughly 25% of daily 3-km echo top (ET) activity during each of Puerto Rico's primary seasons. In contrast, neither mean-layer CAPE, the K index, nor total totals explain more than 11% during any season. When aggregated to the seasonal level, the GDI strongly relates to 3-km ET (R2 = 0.65) and Daymet precipitation totals (R2 = 0.82) during the early rainfall season (ERS; April-July), with correlations weaker outside of this period. The 4-month ERS explains 51% (41%) of the variability to Puerto Rico's annual rainfall during exceptionally wet (dry) years. These findings are valuable for climate downscaling studies predicting Puerto Rico's hydroclimate in future atmospheric states, and they could potentially be adapted for operational seasonal precipitation forecasting.\n",
    "Evidence for the Novel Metabolic Pathway of Ralstonia eutropha H16 to Metabolize L-ascorbate Ryan Joyce, Tyler Stack, Michael Carter": "L-Ascorbate is an antioxidant produced by many eukaryotes and is available for microbial organisms in eukaryotic detritus.Ralstonia eutrophaH16, a soil bacterium that is studied due to its extensive metabolism and bioplastic producing capabilities, can use L-ascorbate via a metabolic pathway that is different from the known pathways ofEscherichia coliand plants. Transcript levels were measured in L-ascorbate-grownRalstonia eutrophaH16 and compared to transcript levels of succinate- and fructose-grownRalstonia eutrophaH16. Genes with a larger than 50-fold upregulation during L-ascorbate growth were investigated. A BLAST search suggested that the proteins encoded by the genes of interest inRalstonia eutrophaH16 differ from enzymes of theEscherichia coliL-ascorbate metabolic pathway. Ralstonia eutrophaH16 does not convert L-ascorbate into L-threonate and oxalate, as plants do. Genes of interest,h16_rs15015andh16_rs19815, were deleted. The resultant mutants do not grow with L-ascorbate. The deletion of specific metabolic genes allows us to better understand their function and importance to the cell's metabolism, furthering our understanding of how different enzymatic metabolic pathways function in nature.\n\nThis abstract is from the Experimental Biology 2019 Meeting.

    "Re-Englishing 'flat-world' fiction": "Utilizing evidence from literary stylistics, and in keeping with the Kachruvian tradition, this paper makes the case for WE scholars to remain vigilant of the move away from the revolutionary heteroglossia and de-Englishing strategies hallmarking literary creation and analyses of postcolonial writings from the margin - so apparent in Braj B. Kachru's works - to a current era of monoglossic inspired re-Englishing strategies underpinning the post-globalist enterprise of so-called 'flat-world' fiction in which under the guise of linguistic deterritorialization, center and periphery stratificational and spatialized arrangements emerge somewhat mitigated - even obfuscated. In the current post-structuralist-turn where contextual-oriented rather than form-focused analyses and the 'spatial turn' prevail, it is contested, Kachruvian-spotlighted linguistic asymmetriesstillmatter. Evidence is provided from emerging frameworks in the sociolinguistics of mobility, pedagogical linguistics, and political economy to demonstrate the intellectual staying power, and relevancy of Kachruvian frameworks for current sociolinguists.\n",
    "A Tale of Two Systems": "With China becoming an economic powerhouse, there has been increasing need for more studies on issues related to information systems localization in China and ways to solve them. Most information systems adoption literatures have been conducted in the context of Western society, especially in America, and due to differences in the cultural, social, and legal environment, these theories and findings out of these studies need to be tested in the context of Chinese culture. This chapter adopts the technology, organization, and environment framework to explain why a Chinese apparel manufacturing company failed in its first enterprise resource planning (ERP) project, and how it achieved success in the second project with government's assistance and what they have learned from their first experience with ERP. This study provides insight on the characteristics of Chinese companies and the unique challenges they have encountered in the informatization process.\n",
    "Disclosure of stigmatized identities at work: An interdisciplinary review and agenda for future research": "This review focuses on the disclosure decisions faced by employees with concealable stigmatized identities--one of the most challenging decisions these individuals must make on a day-to-day basis. Indeed, multiple theoretical frameworks have provided a foundation for understanding the antecedents and outcomes associated with the decision to disclose or not to disclose a stigmatized identity. What is less clear, however, is the extent to which these frameworks have been empirically supported. This systematic review serves to unify the extant literature and prompt continued research related to employees with concealable stigmatized identities. Specifically, we draw upon multiple fields of study, including applied psychology, management, social psychology, and occupational health as a means to systematically synthesize the existing empirical research related to disclosure of stigmatized identities at work. In addition to advancing the scholarly knowledge of disclosure, this review also provides practical utility to organizations as they continue to create work environments that foster inclusion of all stigmatized and nonstigmatized employees.\n",
    "The Intersections of Identities and Justice-Oriented Efforts of Urban Literacy Educators": "This article draws from an ongoing longitudinal qualitative inquiry into the preparation and development of social justice-oriented urban English teachers. It examines the cases of three graduates of an urban education-focused teacher preparation program who claim different intersectional identities and have completed their fourth year as urban educators. The article explores two research questions. First, how do these teachers understand and enact critical education practices within their curriculum and instruction, socially situated relationships, and institutional structures? Second, how do they experience and understand their sociocultural identities as contributors to their practices as critical educators and the associated outcomes? Two findings are discussed. First, the teachers felt greatest agency and success within their classrooms (in comparison to other institutional spaces) to enact social justice-oriented curricula, instruction, and other educational practices, using relationship-building with students as the foundation of their work. Second, identity constructs of gender, age, and race significantly mediated the teachers' relationship-building efforts with colleagues and administrators, the teachers' feelings of agency, and their activities and outcomes related to justice-oriented change at institutional levels beyond the classroom. This study contributes a rare longitudinal example of how in-service critical educators' sociocultural identities impact their literacy pedagogies and institutional efforts to advance educational justice.\n",
    "Mangroves shelter coastal economic activity from cyclones": "Mounting evidence suggests that mangrove forests protect coastal communities during tropical storm events. Yet, no large-scale analysis exists documenting these storm protection benefits globally. We provide global evidence that mangroves shelter economic activity during tropical cyclone exposure and that this sheltering prevents otherwise permanent losses to economic activity. These findings reveal that even modest mangrove forest coverage has the capacity to provide tremendous storm protection services, which highlights the need for mangrove conservation in many vulnerable coastal communities that have prior received less attention.\n",
    "A Comparison of the Types of Problems Encountered by Entrepreneurial Students and Successful Professional Entrepreneurs": "Research examining the similarities and differences between the types of problems that students enrolled in entrepreneurship courses encounter and the types of problems that successful entrepreneurs encounter when working on ventures is limited. Providing projects and activities that closely resemble real-world situations would likely increase the amount of knowledge and skills that students are able to transfer from school into the workforce. In this article, 7 successful professional entrepreneurs and 32 students enrolled in entrepreneurial classes were interviewed and asked to describe the problems that they encountered when working on projects. Fifteen different types of problems were classified based on the interviews. Entrepreneurs did not encounter three types of problems that students struggled with. Students encountered all but three of the same types of problems as entrepreneurs; but within these types of problems, there were some qualitative differences between the two groups. Implications and suggestions for improving courses and activities in entrepreneurship education are discussed.\n",
    "Guidelines for Biosafety in Teaching Laboratories Version 2.0: A Revised and Updated Manual for 2019": "The originalGuidelines for Biosafety in Teaching Laboratorieswere developed in 2012 in response to an outbreak of Salmonella Typhimurium tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that originated from clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. In the 7 years since the publication of the guidelines, there have been two subsequent CDC-reportedSalmonellaoutbreaks originating from clinical and teaching microbiology laboratories. Use of and issues with the guidelines by ASM members have been tracked by various means since publication, and in 2018 it became apparent that an update of the guidelines was necessary. The Education Board of the American Society for Microbiology charged this task force with updating the guidelines based on the accumulated information. While the guidelines should look familiar, users will find that the originally separate BSL1 and BSL2 guidelines have been rolled into one document, to help eliminate redundancy and confusion. In addition, sections on risk assessment and service animals in the teaching laboratory have been added. These updated guidelines should help clarify many of the issues for which users expressed problems with the original guidelines.\n",
    "Critical Ways of Thinking and Learning": "It is important for teacher preparation programs to develop 21st century skills, suggested by the Common Core State Standards as necessary for student success, with the pre-service teachers who will be expected to incorporate these skills into their pedagogy. This chapter traces the critical thinking tools practiced in two different pre-service teacher education courses. A commonality between the courses was the use of particular young adult literature novels to explore critical thinking with pre-service teachers. The authors first identify and explicate six critical ways of thinking and learning employed with pre-service teachers. Second, the authors frame critical thinking through the use of multiple narratives with pre-service teachers. All of the critical thinking tools described in the chapter are supported with examples and provide valuable suggestions for teacher preparation programs.\n",
    "Does Forecast-Accuracy-Based Allocation Induce Customers to Share Truthful Order Forecasts?": "Through a behavioral study, we investigate buyers' strategic order forecasting behavior in a multi-period setting under a forecast accuracy-based allocation policy, where the supplier allocates (proportionally) more inventory to the buyer with the better order forecast accuracy in case of scarce supply. We developed an interactive game that simulates a supply chain in which one supplier sells a key component to two buyers, who in turn sell to consumers. In each period, buyers share forecasts of future orders with their supplier. The participants in the game play the role of a buyer, while the supplier is automated. Our experimental findings suggest that rewarding forecast accuracy in allocating inventory can significantly improve the order forecast accuracy of the buyers and reduce their forecast inflation behavior. Interestingly, even without communication of the policy, buyers learn over time that more accurate forecasts lead to better service from their supplier and improve their order forecast accuracy.\n",
    "Growth of the estuarine fish Fundulus heteroclitus in response to diel-cycling hypoxia and acidification: interaction with temperature": "Growth rate of Fundulus heteroclitus was examined at 25 and 30 degC in nine treatments of diel-cycling dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH. Extreme diel-cycling DO (1-11 mg O2*L-1) negatively impacted growth during 10 days at 30 degC, but not at 25 degC. Moderate DO cycles (3-9 mg O2*L-1) had no direct growth impact at either temperature. Fish did not appear to acclimate, during days 10-30, to the initial growth-limiting effects of extreme diel DO cycles at 30 degC. Diel-cycling DO interacts synergistically with temperature to impact growth. There was no evidence of an independent growth effect of either moderate pH cycles (7.2-7.8) or extreme pH cycles (6.8-8.1) at either temperature. Mean low pCO2levels in extreme cycles were ~32 000 and ~47 000 matm at 25 and 30 degC, respectively. It is noteworthy that these high mean nightly pCO2levels are more than an order of magnitude higher than the chronic mean oceanic pCO2of ~1000 matm projected by the year 2100.\n",
    "The Effects of Trichoderma Fungi on the Tunneling, Aggregation, and Colony-Initiation Preferences of Black-Winged Subterranean Termites, Odontotermes formosanus (Blattodea: Termitidae)": "The black-winged subterranean termite, Odontotermes formosanus Shiraki, is a severe pest of plantations and forests in China. This termite cultures symbiotic Termitomyces in the fungal combs, which are challenged by antagonistic microbes such as Trichoderma fungi. In a previous study we showed that O. formosanus workers made significantly fewer tunnels in sand containing commercially formulated conidia of Trichoderma viride Pers. ex Fries compared with untreated sand. Herein, we hypothesize that fungi in the genus Trichoderma exert repellent effects on O. formosanus. Different choice tests were conducted to evaluate the tunneling and aggregation behaviors of O. formosanus workers reacting to sand/soil containing the unformulated conidia of seven Trichoderma fungi (Trichoderma longibrachiatum Rifai, Trichoderma koningii Oud., Trichoderma harzianum Rifai, Trichoderma hamatum (Bon.) Bain, Trichoderma atroviride Karsten, Trichoderma spirale Indira and Kamala, and T. viride). We also investigated the colony-initiation preference of paired O. formosanus adults to soil treated with Trichoderma conidia (T. koningii or T. longibrachiatum) versus untreated soil. Tunneling-choice tests showed that sand containing conidia of nearly all Trichoderma fungi tested (except T. harzianum) significantly decreased tunneling activity in O. formosanus workers compared with untreated sand. Aggregation-choice test showed that T. koningii, T. atroviride and T. spirale repelled O. formosanus workers, whereas T. longibrachiatum and T. hamatum attracted termites. There was no significant difference in proportions of paired adults that stayed and laid eggs in the soil blocks treated with conidia of Trichoderma fungi and untreated ones. Our study showed that Trichoderma fungi generally repelled tunneling in O. formosanus, but may exert varied effects on aggregation preference by workers.\n",
    "Effect of Vigorous Physical Activity on Executive Control in Middle-School Students": "The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the acute effect of vigorous physical activity on executive control in eighth grade students from the U.S. Participants were eighth grade students (N = 68; 26 girls, 42 boys) recruited from one middle school located in the Mountain West region of the U.S. Two groups of participants were assigned to receive either a vigorous physical activity or a sedentary condition within a counter-balanced cross-over design using a 2-week washout. Both groups were administered Trails Making Tests A (TMT-A) and B (TMT-B) at 20- and 25-min post-treatment, respectively. Mixed design ANOVA tests with repeated measures examined differences between treatments on TMT-A and TMT-B performance and the modifying effect of sex. Students who completed the physical activity condition displayed a faster time to completion on the TMT-B compared to students who completed the sedentary condition (Mean difference = -6.5 s, p = 0.026, d = 0.42). There were no differences between treatment groups on TMT-A and no sex x treatment interactions (p > 0.05). This pilot study suggests that vigorous physical activity may improve executive control in middle-school students and adds to the existent literature that continues to examine the emerging link between physical activity and cognition in school-based settings.\n",

The red imported fire ants,Solenopsis invictaBuren, is an invasive pest in many areas of the world that usually performing food-burying during the foraging processes. However, the impacted factors and measureable patterns of this behavior is largely unknown. In the present study, food-burying vs food-transport behaviors ofSolenopsis invictawere observed under laboratory and field conditions. When starved (no food was provided for 37 days) in the laboratory, food (sausage) was consumed by large numbers of ants, and few burying behaviors were observed. However, when food was provided until satiation of the colonies, food-transport was suppressed and significantly more soil particles were relocated on the food and graph paper square (where the food was placed) when compared with these colonies exposed to starved conditions. Videotapes showed that soil particles (1.47 +- 0.09 mm2) were preferentially placed adjacent to (in contact with) the food items at the beginning; and after the edges were covered, ants transported significantly smaller soil particles (1.13 +- 0.06 mm2) to cover the food. Meanwhile, larger particles (1.96 +- 0.08 mm2) were pulled/dragged around (but not in contact with) the food. Interestingly, only a small number of ants, mainly the small workers, were involved in food-burying, and the ants tended to repeatedly transport soil particles. A total of 12 patterns of particle transport were identified, and soil particles were most frequently picked from the foraging arena and subsequently placed adjacent to the food. In the field, almost all released food was actively transported bySolenopsis invictaworkers, and no burying behavior was observed. Our results show that the food-burying behavior ofSolenopsis invictamay be associated with the suppressed foraging activity, and the burying task may be carried out by certain groups of workers.\n",
    "I guess that is fair: How the efforts of other customers influence buyer price fairness perceptions": "Past research has demonstrated that consumers' price fairness judgments are influenced by comparisons between the offer price they receive and the prices paid by other consumers for the same product offering. In today's digital age, reference points for purchases are more prevalent than ever. However, investigations on how certain inputs of the transaction affect these judgments is lacking. Specifically, extant research has failed to account for how the purchase efforts of other consumers can influence one's own price fairness evaluations. Moreover, relatively little empirical research has endeavored to understand the simultaneous cognitive and affective processes that explain how consumers arrive at price fairness judgments. To address these gaps in the literature, we introduce two studies aimed at understanding the process through which the salient efforts of referent consumers serve to mitigate perceptions of price unfairness when two customers pay different prices for the same product. The findings support a dual-process model whereby the efforts of other (referent) customers serve to simultaneously reduce buyer anger and increase buyer understanding of the price disparity, ultimately mitigating perceptions of price unfairness.\n",
    "Knowledge Sharing From Employee's Perspective": "This chapter combines three less-studied factors on employee knowledge sharing, namely, social relationship, contextual performance, and IT competence. Using a survey study that was targeted to professional employees in a R&D department, we reveal that both social relationship--which incorporates degree of centrality of employee's social network and frequency of interpersonal interaction--and employee's contextual performance have significant positive impacts on knowledge sharing. This association, however, is found to be further positively moderated by employee's IT competence. Our work extends the literature pertaining to knowledge sharing by, not only providing an enhanced approach to measure social relationship, but also emphasizing that social relationship or contextual performance can magnify the impact on knowledge sharing through a high level of IT competence. The findings provide managerial and future research insights pertaining to promoting knowledge sharing by enhancing social relationship, rewarding contextual performance, and improving IT competence of employees.\n",
    "Ecophysiology of mesophotic reef-building corals in Hawai'i is influenced by symbiont-host associations, photoacclimatization, trophic plasticity, and adaptation": "Mesophotic reef corals remain largely unexplored in terms of the genetic adaptations and physiological mechanisms to acquire, allocate, and use energy for survival and reproduction. In the Hawaiian Archipelago, theLeptoserisspecies complex form the most spatially extensive mesophotic coral ecosystem known and provide habitat for a unique community. To study how the ecophysiology ofLeptoserisspecies relates to symbiont-host specialization and understand the mechanisms responsible for coral energy acquisition in extreme low light environments, we examinedSymbiodinium(endosymbiotic dinoflagellate) photobiological characteristics and the lipids and isotopic signatures fromSymbiodiniumand coral hosts over a depth-dependent light gradient (55-7mmol photons m-2s-1, 60-132 m). Clear performance differences demonstrate different photoadaptation and photoacclimatization across this genus. Our results also show that flexibility in photoacclimatization depends primarily onSymbiodiniumtype. Colonies harboringSymbiodiniumsp.COI-2showed significant increases in photosynthetic pigment content with increasing depth, whereas colonies harboringSymbiodiniumspp.COI-1andCOI-3showed variability in pigment composition, yield measurements for photosystem II, as well as size and density ofSymbiodiniumcells. Despite remarkable differences in photosynthetic adaptive strategies, there were no significant differences among lipids ofLeptoserisspecies with depth. Finally, isotopic signatures of both host andSymbiodiniumchanged with depth, indicating that coral colonies acquired energy from different sources depending on depth. This study highlights the complexity in physiological adaptations within this symbiosis and the different strategies used by closely related mesophotic species to diversify energy acquisition and to successfully establish and compete in extreme light-limited environments.\n",
    "Why do females sing?--pair communication and other song functions in eastern bluebirds": "Female bird song has been underappreciated and understudied, especially in temperate species. Birdsong was originally thought to be a trait used primarily by male songbirds for mate attraction and male/male contest. However, ornithologists have long known that females sing in many tropical songbirds, often for similar functions to male song. Yet, studies of female song in temperate regions remain scarce. Increasing our understanding of the function of female song in temperate species is a powerful step towards discerning the selective pressures that maintain elaborate female signals. In the last few decades, studies of temperate species have highlighted five major functional categories of female song. Using a modeling framework, based on all known functions of song in other species, we tested the function of female song in eastern bluebirds. The modeling framework allowed us to test the effect of multiple complex behaviors simultaneously to predict female song function. Additionally, modeling mitigated issues of multiple testing across the five different functional categories. We found that female song in eastern bluebirds is primarily used in pair communication. Specifically, females sing to strengthen and maintain long-term pair bonds. Strengthening pair-bonds may be advantageous for eastern bluebirds as pairs that remain together between nesting attempts and between years have higher reproductive success. We demonstrate a clear link between the function of female song in pair communication and the likely selective force of long-term pair bonds acting on eastern bluebird reproductive success. Additionally, our study highlights a major function of female song in a temperate species.\n",
    "Technical Adequacy of Procedural and Conceptual Algebra Screening Measures in High School Algebra": "Although algebra often functions as a gatekeeper to higher-level mathematics courses and higher education admissions, few quality measures exist for assessing conceptual understanding. This study explored the technical adequacy of three procedural and two conceptual algebra screening measures. We administered three rounds of assessments throughout an algebra course to 2,021 secondary students of 31 teachers in three states. Assessments included procedural and conceptual screening measures and additional criterion measures: teacher ratings of students' algebra proficiency, course grades, results of two project-specific algebra proficiency exams, and state test scores. Descriptive and correlation analyses were used to investigate measure scores, alternate-form and test-retest reliability, concurrent validity, and predictive validity. Procedural measure results indicated high levels of reliability ( r = .72-.99), and moderate concurrent and predictive validity ( r = .36-.64; .36-.58). The conceptual measures produced moderate to low levels of validity ( r = .10-.44). The procedural measure results suggest they may be suitable for use as screening measures, pending further revision and diagnostic testing, while the conceptual measures did not produce acceptable results for current implementation. The findings contributed to measure redesigns to bolster their use as mathematics proficiency assessments with algebra students.\n",
    "Larval Aggregation of Heortia vitessoides Moore (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) and Evidence of Horizontal Transfer of Avermectin": "Aquilaria sinensis (Lour.) Gilg is an economically important tree species that produce the highly prized agarwood. In recent years, agarwood production has been seriously threatened by the outbreak of Heortia vitessoides Moore, a leaf-eating pest that shows gregariousness during the larval stage. However, little attention has been paid to the aggregation behavior of H. vitessoides larvae. In the present study, we collected 102 cohorts of H. vitessoides larvae (13,173 individuals in total) in the wild; 54 cohorts were comprised of the same-instar larvae, and 48 cohorts were comprised of larvae with different developmental stages (instars). In general, young larvae (<third instar) tended to form large aggregations, whereas older-instar larvae were either solitary or formed small aggregations. Laboratory studies showed a strong aggregation tendency in the newly hatched and second-instar larvae of H. vitessoides, whenever the individuals originated from the same or different sibling cohorts. In addition, all newly hatched larvae died within two days after they were isolated. When newly hatched larvae were initially assigned in 10-larvae cohorts (containing sibling individuals) or 20-larvae cohorts (either containing individuals originating from the same or different sibling cohorts), their larval survivorship, duration of larval stage, and adult emergence were not significantly different. Interestingly, combining avermectin-treated larvae (donors) with untreated ones (receptors) significantly decreased larval survivorship and adult emergence of receptors, indicating a horizontal transfer of avermectin among H. vitessoides larvae. This study enhances our understanding of the population ecology of H. vitessoides, and may bring novel insights into the management strategies against this pest.\n",
    "The State of the World's Mangrove Forests: Past, Present, and Future": "Intertidal mangrove forests are a dynamic ecosystem experiencing rapid changes in extent and habitat quality over geological history, today and into the future. Climate and sea level have drastically altered mangrove distribution since their appearance in the geological record ~75 million years ago (Mya), through to the Holocene. In contrast, contemporary mangrove dynamics are driven primarily by anthropogenic threats, including pollution, overextraction, and conversion to aquaculture and agriculture. Deforestation rates have declined in the past decade, but the future of mangroves is uncertain; new deforestation frontiers are opening, particularly in Southeast Asia and West Africa, despite international conservation policies and ambitious global targets for rehabilitation. In addition, geological and climatic processes such as sea-level rise that were important over geological history will continue to influence global mangrove distribution in the future. Recommendations are given to reframe mangrove conservation, with a view to improving the state of mangroves in the future.\n",
    "Effect of Acute Creatine Supplementation on Arterial Stiffness and Muscle Oxygen Saturation": "## Objective:\nTo determine the effects of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation on arterial stiffness (AS) and skeletal muscle oxygen saturation (SmO2). There is a void in our knowledge on the impact of acute creatine monohydrate supplementation on AS in the major elastic arteries. In addition, there is a dearth of findings on the effects of creatine supplementation on SmO2 in the lower leg. Data have indicated that creatine supplementation can result in an increase in lower leg anterior compartment pressure at rest and post exercise. Although the increased pressures seen during these studies were not pathological, this and additional factors associated with creatine supplementation could possibly effect SmO2 during exercise and recovery.\n\n## Methods:\n20 male, physically active participants were randomized in a double-blind fashion to placebo (PL) (n=10, 22.9+-3.1 yrs.) or creatine (CM) (n=10, 21.3+-1.8 yrs.) groups. Subjects received 0.3 g/kg/day creatine monohydrate or placebo in gelatin capsules for 7 days. Ultrasonography of the carotid artery, applanation tonometry, submaximal exercise tests (10 minute treadmill activity at 3.7 mph and 9% incline), SmO2, and lower leg pain (analog visual scale and pain test algometer) assessments were conducted at baseline and on day 7 of the study period.\n\n## Results:\nThere were baseline differences in central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) (mean difference, 109; 95% confidence interval (CI) 105 to 113, vs. mean difference, 130; 95% CI 114 to 146, p < 0.05) between the PLA and CM groups, respectively. Following the intervention, there were no significant differences between PL and CM in arterial stiffness indices between the groups. There was a significant group effect (P<0.03) but no significant effect of supplementation (P>0.05) on the % change in SmO2 during the exercise tests (CM: pre 66.49 +- 30.54; post 59.61 +- 23.87 vs. PL: pre 39.87 +- 16.72; post 38.51 +- 26.95 % change SmO2; M +- SD). Percent fat free mass (FFM) was significantly increased (mean, 68.5+-7.5%; 95% CI 62.1% to 72.9%, to mean 69.3+-7.5% 95% CI 62.9% to 73.6%, P<0.05) in the CM group only. There were no other significant changes in anthropometric measurements.\n\n## Conclusions:\nUsing a randomly controlled, double-blind trial with validated measurements of AS and SmO2, acute creatine supplementation does not appear to impact vascular compliance or oxygen saturation in skeletal muscle in young, healthy males.\n",
    "Undergraduate Research in Mathematics Education: Using Qualitative Data About Children's Learning to Make Decisions About Teaching": "Undergraduate research is increasingly prevalent in many fields of study, but it is not yet widespread in mathematics education. We argue that expanding undergraduate research opportunities in mathematics education would be beneficial to the field. Such opportunities can be impactful as either extracurricular or course-embedded experiences. To help readers envision directions for undergraduate research experiences in mathematics education with prospective teachers, we describe a model built on a design-based research paradigm. The model engages pairs of prospective teachers in working with faculty mentors to design instructional sequences and test the extent to which they support children's learning. Undergraduates learn about the nature of systematic mathematics education research and how careful analyses of classroom data can guide practice. Mentors gain opportunities to pursue their personal research interests while guiding undergraduate pairs. We explain how implementing the core cycle of the model, whether on a small or large scale, can help teachers make instructional decisions that are based on rich, qualitative classroom data.\n",
    "Flyby Measurement of the Magnetic Field of a Helmholtz Coil with a Smart Cart": "The use of smartphones in experimental physics is by now widely accepted and documented. PASCO scientific's smart cart, in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps, has opened up a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost-saving achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional laboratory sensors, wires, air tracks, interface boards, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart and the free SPARKvue app for the smart cart by carrying out flyby measurements of the magnetic field of a Helmholtz coil. Recently, Monteiro et al. reported a similar experiment with a single coil but with an ordinary laboratory cart, and had to use the accelerometer of a smart-phone to laboriously extract the precise position of the mag-netic field sensor of the smartphone. The use of the smart cart in this report obviates the need for using the accelerometer and the concomitant laborious extraction of the position data. The eponymous smart cart broadcasts its precise location wirelessly over Bluetooth(r). In addition to the single circular coil verification of the Biot-Savart law, we also used the Helmholtz coil to generate and measure a uniform magnetic field over a wide central region.\n",
    "Silence is sexy: soundscape complexity alters mate choice in tungara frogs": "Many animals acoustically communicate in large aggregations, producing biotic soundscapes. In turn, these natural soundscapes can influence the efficacy of animal communication, yet little is known about how variation in soundscape interferes with animals that communicate acoustically. We quantified this variation by analyzing natural soundscapes with the mid-frequency cover index and by measuring the frequency ranges and call rates of the most common acoustically communicating species. We then tested female mate choice in the tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus) in varying types of background chorus noise. We broadcast two natural tungara frog calls as a stimulus and altered the densities (duty cycles) of natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics to form the different types of chorus noise. During both conspecific and heterospecific chorus noise treatments, females demonstrated similar preferences for advertisement calls at low and mid noise densities but failed to express a preference in the presence of high noise density. Our data also suggest that nights with high densities of chorus noise from conspecifics and heterospecifics are common in some breeding ponds, and on nights with high noise density, the soundscape plays an important role diminishing the accuracy of female decision-making.\n",
    "A retrospective chart review evaluating the relationship between cancer diagnosis and drinking water source on the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland.": "e13587\n\nBackground: The lower Eastern Shore of Maryland is an agricultural and rural region with high cancer rates. The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine if cancer patients on the lower Eastern Shore utilize higher rates of well water compared to individuals in the general county population. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all cases of colon, lung, melanoma and breast cancer diagnosed at Peninsula Regional Medical Center in 2017 was completed. Demographic and clinical information including family, smoking and prior cancer history, as well as residential water source were recorded. Individuals with residential addresses outside of Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset counties were excluded. Overall well water use for each county was determined using U.S. 2010 census data. Fisher's exact test was used to compare well water utilization rates in cancer patients and the overall county population. Results: 631 patient cases were reviewed and 384 patients were identified for data analysis. The majority of patients were white (81%), diagnosed with breast cancer (41%), and used well water (52%, n = 209). Cancer patients in the three counties combined were significantly more likely to use well water than individuals in the general county population (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 2.11, 3.16). In Wicomico county, 61% of cancer patients used well water (n = 140). Wicomico cancer patients were more likely to use well water than individuals in the general Wicomico county population (OR = 4.4, 95% CI 3.41, 5.78). No significant findings were observed for patients living in Worcester and Somerset counties. No differences in family, smoking or prior cancer history in patients using well water versus municipal water were identified. Conclusions: Cancer patients on the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland used well water more than municipal water. Cancer patients also utilized higher rates of well water compared to individuals in the general county population. Interpretation is limited by small sample size and lack of causality, however the results signal a need for additional studies evaluating well water use and cancer risk in this region.\n",
    "Analysis of Published PCR Primers to Determine Sex of Industrial Hemp Seedlings": "Industrial hemp refers to non-intoxicating strains ofCannabis sativathat produce high levels of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), the precursor to cannabidiol (CBD). CBD has known health benefits and is being tested for a wide range of potential medicinal uses. When growing hemp for CBD, unfertilized female plants are desired as they produce high amounts of CBDA in their flower organs. Therefore, early identification and elimination of male hemp plants is imperative and allows cultivators to spend fewer resources on plants that won't produce flower and could possibly pollinate female plants. It has been reported that male cannabis plants can be identified weeks before they show any visual sex features using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), however the results from reported studies have been inconsistent in identifying male plants. Here, genomic DNA from thirteen hemp seedlings was analyzed using male-DNA-specific PCR primer pairs described in the research literature. Three different primer pairs (SCAR323, SCAR119, and MADC2) were used in the analyses. SCAR323 primers have been reported to amplify a male-specific amplicon of 323 base pairs (bp); SCAR119 have been reported to amplify a male-associated amplicon of 119 bp; and MADC2 primers have been reported to amplify a male-associated amplicon of 300 bp and a female-associated amplicon of 450 bp. PCR analyses showed DNA from all 13 of our tested hemp seedlings produced a single SCAR323 amplicon of around 320 bp, suggesting this primer set might not be useful for sex determination. A SCAR119 amplicon of the expected size was seen using DNA from 6 of the 13 seedlings. The DNA from the same 6 plants produced an amplicon of about 400 bp using the MADC2 primers, while DNA from plants that lacked SCAR119 amplicon showed a MADC2 amplicon of about 550 bp. After seven weeks of growth, the hemp plants revealed the presence of male or female reproductive organs. The presence of male pollen sacs correlated with the SCAR119 amplicon and the MADC2 amplicon of 400 bp, indicating these primer sets could be a useful tools for determining plant sex at the seedling stage.\n",
    "Finding molecular targets to reverse nerve degeneration associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)": "One of the most common comorbidities associated with diabetes mellitus is diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which is the progressive degeneration of peripheral nerves. The manner in which DPN develops and the underlying mechanisms of peripheral nerve degeneration are currently unknown. Our lab has characterized a glucose-induced model of DPN in zebrafish (Danio rerio) in which we observe defasciculation/degeneration of motor axons, decreased myelination, and a decrease in ensheathment by perineurial glia. Currently, we are interested in characterizing the molecular pathways involved in the degeneration we observe. To accomplish this, we are testing dexamethasone, a FDA-characterized small molecule drug, in an effort to decrease the degree of nerve degeneration present after DPN onset. Beginning 5 days post fertilization (dpf) experimental larvae were immersed in 120 mMd-glucose for 7 seven days to induce DPN. At 10 dpf, larvae were additionally incubated with 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a 1:1000 dilution of dexamethasone. As a control, a group of larvae were exposed to the same conditions without the addition of the drug treatment.Tg(nkx2.2a:meGFP)fish were used to allow visualization of perineurial glia 12 dpf using EVOS fluorescent microscopy. The percentage of motor axons ensheathed by perineurial glia was measured and quantified using FIJI. An increase in motor axons ensheathed by perineurial glia was apparent, furthermore the number of perineurial cells surrounding the motor axons appeared to increase as well. This increase in perineurial glia is meaningful because these cells form the blood-nerve-barrier, have phagocytic capabilities, and have also been shown to provide guidance cues for axonal regrowth. Future work will focus on characterizing the pathways affected by dexamethasone to uncover the molecular mechanisms potentially responsible for facilitating nerve regeneration after DPN onset.\n\n## Support or Funding Information:\nSupport was provided by the Henson School of Science and Technology at Salisbury University.\n",
    "Seeing through Serpent and Eagle Eyes: Teachers as Handlers of Memories": "## Background/Context:\nThis paper is part of the special issue \"Reimagining Research and Practice at the Crossroads of Philosophy, Teaching, and Teacher Education.\" We propose that there is a vital connection in teaching between curriculum and memories that should be fostered in our classrooms. Because memories are alive and bring meaning to our lives, they need to be handled with care. Unfortunately, however, much of teaching risks to simply embalm what is already dead. We examine how the living work of teachers might reposition curriculum as a body of dynamic memories: a constellation of struggles and belongings, failures and accomplishments. The role of the teacher, in this context, is as a handler of those memories.\n\n## Research Design:\nOur approach derives from sustained interaction as we have sought to bring our scholarly backgrounds in philosophy of education and English teacher education, respectively, into dynamic contact. The methodology of the inquiry is mixed in that it combines teacher narratives (our own) with critical conceptual analysis, collective memory work, and phenomenology. Drawing on a bibliography of texts organized collaboratively by the larger research group, our main authors of reference are Freire, Gramsci, Anzaldua, Style, and Britzman. We also feature several fine-grained narratives that illuminate what we mean by \"handlers of memory\" in the educational setting.\n\n## Conclusions/Recommendations:\nOur shared philosophizing in this paper is a response to the concern that classroom teaching contributes to the deadening of curriculum as a source of meaning and an avenue for students and teachers to learn about themselves. In response, we propose the image of teachers as handlers of memory who work to cultivate and keep memories alive and central to learning. We recommend that teachers explore collective memory work (Haug, 1999) and reflective teaching narratives (Furman, 2015) as ways to get a handle on their own powerful memories of teaching.\n",

    "E-Government and Related Indices": "The primary United Nations E-Government Index is a composite of three component indices: telecommunications infrastructure, human capital, and online e-government services, where the first two can be seen as enablers of the third. This study investigates the addition of a complementary component index for institutional efficacy, which is hypothesized to be another enabling factor. The institutional efficacy index is operationalized using existing measures gathered and made available by the World Bank. Statistical analysis shows that the institutional efficacy index is indeed a significant, additional predictor of online e-government services across nations.

Preliminary analyses of changes over time are also presented using data from prior years, and directions for future research are outlined.\n",
    "Complex sensory environments alter mate choice outcomes": "Noise is a common problem in animal communication. We know little, however, about how animals communicate in noise using multimodal signals. Multimodal signals are hypothesized to be favoured by evolution because they increase the efficacy of detection/discrimination in noisy environments. We tested the hypothesis that female tungara frogs' responses to attractive male advertisement calls are improved in noise when a visual signal component is added to the available choices. We tested this at two levels of decision complexity (two and three choices). In a two-choice test, the presence of noise did not reduce female preferences for attractive calls. The visual component of a calling male, associated with an unattractive call, also did not reduce preference for attractive calls in the absence of noise. In the presence of noise, however, females were more likely to choose an unattractive call coupled with the visual component. In three-choice tests, the presence of noise alone reduced female responses to attractive calls and this was not strongly affected by the presence or absence of visual components. The responses in these experiments fail to support the multimodal signal efficacy hypothesis. Instead, the data suggest that audio-visual perception and cognitive processing, related to mate choice decisions, are dependent on the complexity of the sensory scene.\n",
    "The use of unmanned aircraft systems and high-resolution satellite imagery to monitor tilapia fish-cage aquaculture expansion in Lake Victoria, Kenya": "Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the tropics, has a storied history that includes recent shifts in ecology due to a variety of point and nonpoint source anthropogenic impacts. Among the expanding industries contributing to environmental impacts (if not properly managed) is the recent\n and rapid expansion of cage aquaculture of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). As part of an effort to assess the ecological consequences of this new industry, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), very high-resolution satellite imagery, and geographic information systems (GIS) were used\n to map the tilapia fish cages in the Kenya portion of Lake Victoria, Africa. Understanding the impacts of the growth of commercial finfish cage culture within Lake Victoria requires a systems view which, through the use of UAS and satellite technologies, can provide spatial context and change\n detection. This synthesis of UAS, very high-resolution satellite imagery, and GIS has allowed for accurate and rapid mapping of inshore tilapia fish cages with high positional accuracy. The significance of these observations lies in the speed and detection accuracy in the methodology, allowing\n for rapid visualization and assessment of cage culture in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria. As of 2012, there were very few floating aquaculture finfish cages in the Kenyan portion of Lake Victoria. Using UAS, satellite, and GIS technologies, in 2018 the same portion of the lake was found\n to contain 4357 fish cages covering 62,132 m>2.\n",
    "Reforming School Discipline: Responses by School District Leadership to Revised State Guidelines for Student Codes of Conduct": "Purpose: Over the past decade, increasing attention to the negative impacts of exclusionary discipline and disparities therein has led many state educational leaders to enact school discipline reforms. This study examined the response by school district leadership to a state's revision of guidelines for student codes of conduct. Data: This study leveraged longitudinal data on school district codes of conduct from the 2013-2014 to 2015-2016 school years across the state of Maryland. Codes of conduct were coded in an iterative fashion according to a common set of infraction-response combinations. Research Design: Using a pre-post analytic design, this study examined changes in districts' codified infractions, responses to infractions, and the overall tier of response. Furthermore, the study compared alignment between state guidelines and district codes of conduct while exploring variation in codified discipline across districts. Findings: Findings suggest that leaders in districts increased the number of response options available for most types of infractions, with the largest increases occurring for more serious infractions. While these increases tended to be driven by increases in the codification of less exclusionary responses, there were nevertheless sizeable increases in the availability of in-school suspension and removal/intervention. In almost all cases, school districts reported distributions of response options that were at a higher tier level than that recommended by the state. Conclusions: Findings are discussed in the context of current efforts to reform school discipline and the implications of such reform for implementation by district and school leadership.\n",
    "Inhibition of PIM kinase with fractionated radiation and docetaxel in preclinical prostate cancer models.": "e17534\n\nBackground: PIM kinases are highly expressed in high risk prostate cancer and are associated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis, presenting a therapeutic target. Methods: We studied PIM inhibition (PIMi) in both hormone-dependent (LNCaP) and -independent (DU145, 22Rv1) prostate cancer cell lines and mouse xenografts. We evaluated PIMi effects via Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and RNAseq of multiple relevant pathways, and performed radiosensitization analysis with colony formation assays. We also investigated xenograft tumor growth with PIMi +/- radiation (RT) or docetaxel. Results: Pretreating the cell lines with PIMi prior to RT caused marked changes in H2AX phosphorylation compared to no PIMi + RT, with most significant alteration in DU145. However, in colony formation assays, 22Rv1 showed greatest radiosensitization with colony survival reduced from 23% to 15% with PIMi. 22Rv1 xenografts were grown in castrated mice, which were randomized to 30 Gy in 15 treatments vs no RT over 3 weeks, -/+ PIMi on RT days. RT + PIMi eliminated gross tumor, compared to an average of 78% and 51% of initial tumor volumes remaining with PIMi alone and RT alone, respectively. Immunofluorescence and Western blotting of harvested tumors showed PIMi altered patterns in proteins involved with hypoxic response (COX-2), cell survival (MDM2), and androgen receptor and suggested interactions between RT and PIMi for both MDM2 and androgen receptor but not COX-2. RNAseq analysis of xenografts showed daily PIMi affected multiple pathways involved in metabolism, growth, and DNA repair. Finally, we tested PIMi -/+ docetaxel in castrated mice with hormone-sensitive (LNCaP) or -resistant (22Rv1) xenografts treated with PIMi -/+ docetaxel. With both xenografts, PIMi + docetaxel reduced tumor size best, with 22Rv1 xenografts most dramatically showing 74% volume reduction from baseline with PIMi + docetaxel compared to 50% and 25% reduction in volumes with PIMi alone and docetaxel alone, respectively. Conclusions: PIMi has multiple pathway effects in prostate cancer. PIMi significantly reduces disease burden, particularly in combination with RT or docetaxel. Our data provide rationale for testing PIMi in clinical trials for prostate cancer.\n",

    "A Retrospective Chart Review Evaluating the Relationship between Cancer Diagnosis and Residential Water Source on the Lower Eastern Shore of Maryland, USA": "Well water contamination in heavily agricultural regions has previously been linked with increased cancer incidence and mortality. The lower Eastern shore of Maryland is a rural, agricultural region with some of the highest rates of cancer in Maryland and the United States. Our study sought to characterize residential private well water use among cancer patients on the lower Eastern shore of Maryland, and to compare private well water utilization between cancer patients and the general regional population. Retrospective chart review was conducted to identify patients diagnosed with colon, lung, melanoma or breast cancer at a regional hospital from 1 January 2017 through 31 December 2018. Residential water source was determined using residential address and municipal water records. Fisher's exact test was used to compare residential private well water utilization between our study population and the baseline regional population. The majority of cancer patients (57%) lived in homes supplied by private well water (428/746). Cancer patients were more likely to live in homes supplied by private well water compared to individuals in the general regional population (57% vs. 32%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, cancer patients on the lower Eastern shore of Maryland were more likely to live in homes supplied by residential private well water than the regional population. Additional studies are needed to evaluate well water use and cancer risk in this vulnerable region.\n",
    "The Right Light: Tiger Salamander Capture Rates and Spectral Sensitivity": "Knowledge of population dynamics is critical for species of conservation concern so wildlife researchers need to take advantage of biases in animals' behaviors that could help them monitor populations. This is particularly important for amphibians because many populations are declining and difficult to observe. Attraction of vertebrates to light is a well-known navigational cue and some fisheries strategies utilize light sources to increase catch success. To optimize population monitoring of state-endangered eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum), we tested the utility of colored glow sticks (green, orange, pink, or yellow) as bait in traps in Maryland and Delaware, USA, during 2015-2016. We then measured intensities of the colored glow sticks and estimated photoreceptive quantum catches of each color according to the spectral sensitivities of eastern tiger salamanders. We found that eastern tiger salamanders' photoreceptors had greater quantum catches of photons from green and yellow glow sticks. However, traps baited with orange glow sticks were more than twice as likely to capture eastern tiger salamanders than were traps baited with green or yellow. There were no differences in the number of salamanders caught per successful trap among glow stick colors, perhaps due to attraction of salamanders to motion from previously captured salamanders. Our results indicate that biases other than perceived intensity of light sources may drive behavioral preferences. (c) 2020 The Wildlife Society.\n",
    "Characterization of L-Ascorbate Metabolism in Ralstonia eutropha H16": "L-Ascorbate (Vitamin C), a primary antioxidant in plants and animals, is an abundant carbon source highly produced by plants so is an available carbon source for soil bacteria. We previously identified a novel L-ascorbate metabolic strategy inRalstonia eutrophaH16 (Cupriavidus necatorATCC 17699) by eight enzymes up to three transporters; the first enzyme is a membrane bound L-ascorbate oxidoreductase (LaaO). Which face of LaaO, periplasmic or cytoplasmic, is catalytic was investigated by complementation of anlaaOmutant with a cytoplasmic plant L-ascorbate oxidase. Growth with L-ascorbate of two of the three transporter deletion mutants was impaired but not abolished. The growth defects correlated with concentrations of L-ascorbate or spontaneous degradation products in the media. Transcript levels of each transporter gene, fluorescence of mCherry-transporter fusion mutants, and the L-ascorbate and dehydroascorbate concentrations were monitored to observe the regulation of transporter genes. This work elaborates on environmental carbon cycling by a novel L-ascorbate pathway found in hundreds of bacteria while clarifying transporter function in three different protein families.\n",
    "Characterizing a Novel L-Ascorbate Metabolic Pathway in Bacteria": "L-Ascorbate, commonly known as Vitamin C, is a naturally abundant carbon source produced in high quantities by plants. The involvement of L-ascorbate as an antioxidant in processes within the body systems of mammals is well studied, yet L-ascorbate can also function as a carbon source for some bacterial species.Ralstonia eutrophaH16 (Cupriavidus necatorH16) is a soil bacterium that stores excess carbon in bioplastic granules and catabolizes L-ascorbate via a previously unknown metabolic pathway. Transcripts for eight genes were upregulated >50-fold inR. eutrophacells grown with L-ascorbate compared to fructose or succinate. Three encode homologs of enzymes in L-lyxonate catabolism to a-ketoglutarate. Based on annotated functions of the five remaining enzymes, a predicated pathway was hypothesized to generate a-ketoglutarate from L-ascorbate. Enzymes not homologous to the L-lyxonate pathway enzymes were purified and characterizedin vitroby collaborators. MutantR. eutrophastrains were generated, each lacking one of the eight genes, and displayed significant growth defects when grown with L-ascorbate. Support for a novel pathway for L-ascorbate catabolism increases our knowledge of related enzyme functions and the involvement of L-ascorbate in the carbon cycle.\n",
    "Synthesis of a Water-Soluble, Soft N-Donor BTzBP Ligand Containing Only CHON": "A hydrophilic ligand that contains only C, H, O, and N substituents and uses a 6,6'-bis(1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-2,2'-bipyridine (BTzBP) structural core has been synthesized. The effect of adding water-soluble groups onto extractant ligands has been extensively studied to facilitate the efficient partitioning of 4f and transuranic 5f elements for the treatment of spent nuclear fuel. Soft, N-donor ligands exhibit greater binding affinities for the trivalent actinides over the trivalent lanthanides, making BTzBP ligands an ideal candidate in the search for extractants to be used on an industrial scale. To date, hydrophobic BTzBPs have been shown to exhibit physical and chemical properties that might be conducive to nuclear waste processing conditions. However, hydrophilic BTzBPs have yet to be reported. Herein, we show the synthesis of a hydrophilic BTzBP ligand featuring cationic water solubilizing groups attached to the bipyridal rings.\n",
    "The American Government Textbook: Looking Beyond Pluralism": "In this study, I look at 15 introductory American government textbooks to assess the degree to which they move beyond traditional models of pluralism and toward a more critical approach of one that reflects recent scholarship. I find that the great majority of texts, perhaps fearing that a more critical approach would lead to political and civic disengagement by undergraduates, present an overly idealized version of American government and politics.\n",

The holomorphic part of this function has a transformation rule that we express in finite terms as a generalized Dedekind sum. This gives rise to the explicit construction (in finite terms) of elements of [Formula: see text]. We also give a short proof of the reciprocity formula for this Dedekind sum.\n",
    "Using Big Data to Understand Chinese Users' Intentions to Tap Through Mobile Advertisements": "This study examines influencing factors for users' intentions to tap through mobile advertisements. This chapter uses a data set with 115,899 records of ad tap-through from a mobile advertising company in China to fit a logit model to examine how the probability of advertisement tap-through is related to the identified factors. The results show that the influencing variables are application type, mobile operators, scrolling frequency, and the regional income level as they are positively correlated with the likelihood whether users would tap on certain types of advertising. Moreover, a Bayesian network model is used to estimate the conditional probability for a user to tap on an advertisement in an application after the user already taps on another advertisement in the same application. Based on the findings, strategies for mobile advertisers to engage in effective and targeted mobile advertising are proposed.\n",
    "'A very very long amount of time passes': Slowness, cinema and Annie Baker's The Flick (2013)": "Annie Baker's 2013 playThe Flickprompted divisive reactions from its audience from the time of its original run, ones largely based on the play's feeling extremely slow. Setting out from the intersection of the play's temporal affect and the play's setting - a movie theatre - this article builds on recent work on slow-cinema scholarship, particularly as it relates to theatrical exhibition, to explore contemporary discourse on both slowness and cinema. Going further, it sets this work against the backdrop of broader, multi-disciplinary conversations about the cultures of speed and slowness, before considering the particular slowness inThe Flickas well as its evocation of the theatrical experience. Finally, the article concludes by asking what it means today to attend the cinema.\n",
    "What we know and don't know about the socioeconomic impacts of mobile money in Sub-Saharan Africa: A systematic literature review": "Mobile money has been viewed as transformative in developing countries, because it provides basic financial services via mobile phones to people who lack easy access to formal financial services such as bank accounts. Given its accessibility, security, and affordability, mobile money has been increasingly touted as a promising digital solution for socioeconomic development in Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite its potentially disruptive impacts, research on this innovation remains fragmentary. To take stock of what is known and to advance future research, a systematic review was conducted of 82 empirical academic studies on the socioeconomic impacts of mobile money in Sub-Saharan Africa. Results show that mobile money, when widely used in Sub-Saharan African countries, has enabled a wide range of socioeconomic benefits at multiple levels including household welfare, business benefits, community development, financial development, and country well-being. In addition, the systematic review reveals multifaceted research biases and gaps in the literature and accordingly suggests promising directions for future research.\n",
    "Job insecurity and subjective sleep quality: The role of spillover and gender": "Perceived job insecurity is a critical job stressor that creates the conditions for negative health and performance outcomes for workers while potentially increasing health-related costs for employers. Sleep quality, an important proxy of health, has been understudied in relation to the impact of perceived job insecurity. Using job stress concepts and a perseverative cognition model, this study examines the association between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep quality while considering negative work spillover as a mediator. We expand our analysis to consider gender as a moderator of the job insecurity-sleep quality relationship, predicting the relationship will be stronger for men than for women. Study 1 uses a nationally representative sample from the Midlife Development in the United States National Survey Refresher study consisting of 1031 working adults and a multi-group path analysis to test our hypotheses. Results show that negative work spillover mediates the relationship between perceived job insecurity and subjective sleep quality. Study 2 uses a sample of 152 working adults who participated in three biweekly surveys. The mediating role of negative work spillover is replicated in Study 2. In both studies, no gender moderation is found. Theoretical and methodological contributions, limitations and future research directions are discussed.\n",
    "Leader Behavioral Integrity and Employee In-Role Performance: The Roles of Coworker Support and Job Autonomy": "The positive relationship between leader behavioral integrity and an employee's in-role performance is well-established, but explanations for why this effect exists are still in a nascent stage. Drawing upon leader behavioral integrity theory and job-demands resources theory, the authors explain how leader behavioral integrity facilitates employee in-role performance and the boundary conditions influencing the relationship between leader behavioral integrity and employee in-role performance. Using multisource data from 209 employee-manager dyads in South Korea, this paper found support for the mediating effect of coworker support in the positive relationship between leader behavior integrity and employees' in-role autonomy. Furthermore, compared to those who perceive low job autonomy, the positive indirect effect of leader behavioral integrity on in-role performance via coworker support was stronger for employees who perceive high job autonomy. The findings emphasize the importance of a leader's individual difference (i.e., leader behavioral integrity) and job resources (i.e., job autonomy) facilitating the receipt of team members' supporting behaviors which, in turn, energize employee in-role performance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n",
    "The cross-cultural moderators of the influence of emotional intelligence on organizational citizenship behavior and counterproductive work behavior": "This meta-analysis found that the emotional intelligence-organizational citizenship behavior relationship is stronger in long-term oriented and restraint cultures. However, this relationship does not differ between individualistic and collectivistic cultures, masculine and feminine cultures, high uncertainty avoidance and low uncertainty avoidance cultures, and high power distance and low power distance cultures. The emotional intelligence-counterproductive work behavior relationship is stronger in collectivistic, feminine, high uncertainty avoidance, high power distance, long-term oriented, and restraint cultures. Emotional intelligence-organizational citizenship behavior/counterproductive work behavior relationships are mediated by both state positive affect and state negative affect. Human resource development professionals from cultures where the effects of emotional intelligence are stronger are especially recommended to hire emotionally intelligent employees and/or provide emotional intelligence training to stimulate organizational citizenship behavior and to restrain counterproductive work behavior. Although there are important cross-cultural differences, emotional intelligence universally encourages organizational citizenship behavior and almost universally diminishes counterproductive work behavior across cultures.\n",
    "Investors' Responses to Social Conflict between CSR and Corporate Tax Avoidance": "There is often conflict between disclosures and actions in corporate operations. One area of interest relates to the joint influence of tax avoidance and Corporate Social Responsibility on economic outcomes. We evaluate investor perceptions when these corporate behaviors are in conflict, and our results indicate that tax avoidance negatively influences investment decisions. We find that although CSR in isolation has no direct effect, the negative influence of tax avoidance is tempered when it is present. We provide evidence that not only do a firm's policies related to CSR and tax avoidance result in diverse investment intentions, but also that it is the individual's unique beliefs on ethics and CSR that appear to be driving these differences. Our results suggest that espousing stakeholder values serves as a shield to protect the company from the negative consequences associated with tax avoidance, and that individual attitudes can shape perceptions relative to these behaviors.\n",
    "Shareholder coordination and corporate innovation": "We show that greater shareholder coordination, as proxied by the geographic proximity between institutional investors, is positively related to corporate innovation outcomes. This relationship is driven by coordination among dedicated and independent institutions who have strong monitoring incentives and is more pronounced among firms with lower blockholder ownership and greater information asymmetry where there is greater benefit to monitoring. We propose that shareholder coordination promotes corporate innovation through a reduction in managerial agency problems. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion that greater shareholder coordination enables diffuse shareholders to monitor managers more effectively and enhances corporate innovation.\n",
    "Formalizing Performance Evaluation of Mobile Manipulator Robots Using CTML": "Computation Tree Measurement Language (CTML) is a newly developed formal language that offers simultaneous model verification and performance evaluation measures. While the theory behind CTML has been established, the language has yet to be tested on a practical example. In this work, we wish to demonstrate the utility of CTML when applied to a real-world application based in manufacturing. Mobile manipulators may enable more flexible, dynamic workflows within industry. Therefore, an artifact-based performance measurement test method for mobile manipulator robots developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology was selected for evaluation. Contributions of this work include the modeling of robot tasks implemented for the performance measurement test using Petri nets, as well as the formulation and execution of sample queries using CTML. To compare the numerical results, query support, ease of implementation, and empirical runtime of CTML to other temporal logics in such applications, the queries were re-formulated and evaluated using the PRISM Model Checker. Finally, a discussion is included that considers future extensions of this work, relative to other existing research, that could potentially enable the integration of CTML with Systems Modeling Language (SysML) and Product Life-cycle Management (PLM) software solutions.\n",
    "Patient Assessment and Chronic Pain Self-Management in Ethnomedicine: Seasonal and Ecosystemic Embodiment in Ayurvedic Patient-Centered Care": "Background: Ayurveda's preventive focus complements its strength with the interventionist approach of the biomedical in chronic pain self-management. Patient-centered care (PCC) using ethnomedicine promises greater patient self-management; however, few studies have examined environmental relationships and PCC in self-management of chronic pain through Ayurveda. Objective: To examine how Ayurveda's philosophical focus on whole system frameworks describes the integration of the individual and the ecological in tailoring an integrative patient-centered diagnostic and prognostic approach to chronic pain management. Methods: This qualitative case study conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews of Ayurvedic physicians from India (N = 10) and a qualitative inductive content analytic approach. Findings: The diagnostic and interpretational framework of the doshas supports the integration of the individual and the ecological through (a) the circadian and seasonal cycles relating mind-body awareness with diet, lifestyle (e.g., yoga), and breath (e.g., pranayama), and (b) biogeographical and ecosystemic regions relating the biogeographical and the ecological (e.g., desh) with the regulatory principle of pain and its physiological and anatomical perception (vata) in an approach that goes beyond treating pain etiology to a whole person PCC approach. Conclusions: The study highlights how circadian and seasonal cycles and evolutionary spatial-temporal factors of biogeographical and ecological regions are employed in patient assessment and self-management to support patient involvement. Recommendations for PCC in integrative chronic pain management include supporting patient ownership of their care through the dosha framework that relates the individual and the ecological in the patient's own life-context and supports co-creation of a collaborative plan of care using an ethnomedical framework.\n",
    "Regression modelling with the tilted beta distribution: A Bayesian approach": "Beta regression models are commonly used in the case of a dependent variableythat exists on the range (0,1). However, whenycan additionally take on the values of zero and/or one, limitations of the beta distribution and beta regression models become apparent. One recent approach is to use an inflated beta regression model which has discrete point-valued components. In this article, we introduce a new class of regression models fory [0,1] that is fully continuous. This allows the entirety ofyto be treated as a continuum instead of discontinuously, which appears to be a new development for the literature. We use a Bayesian approach for estimation. We also illustrate the impact of different choices of prior distributions on empirical findings and perform a simulation study examining model fit.\n",
    "Effects of a tropical cyclone on salt marsh insect communities and post-cyclone reassembly processes": "Concepts regarding effects of recurrent natural disturbances and subsequent responses of communities are central to ecology and conservation biology. Tropical cyclones constitute major disturbances producing direct effects (damage, mortality) in many coastal communities worldwide. Subsequent reassembly involves changes in composition and abundance for which the underlying mechanisms (deterministic and stochastic processes) are still not clear, especially for mobile organisms. We examined tropical cyclone-induced changes in composition and reassembly of entire insect communities in 16 Louisiana coastal salt marshes before and after Hurricane Isaac in 2012 and 2013. We used the Shannon index and multivariate permutational ANOVA to study insect resistance and resilience, b diversity partitioning to evaluate the importance of species replacement, and null models to disentangle the relative roles of different assembly processes over time after the tropical cyclone. The a diversity and species composition, overall and for different trophic levels, decreased immediately after the tropical cyclone; nonetheless, both then increased rapidly and returned to pre-cyclone states within one year. Changes in species abundance, rather than species replacement, was the primary driver, accounting for most temporal dissimilarity among insect communities. Stochastic processes, which drove community composition immediately after the tropical cyclone, decreased in importance over time. Our study indicates that rapid reformation of insect communities involved sequential landscape-level dynamics. Cyclone-resistant life cycle stages apparently survived in some, perhaps random locations within the overall salt marsh landscape. Subsequently, stochastic patterns of immigration of mobile life cycle stages resulted in rapid reformation of local communities. Post-cyclone direct regeneration of salt marsh insect communities resulted from low resistance, coupled with high landscape-level resilience via re-immigration. Our study suggests that the extent of direct regeneration of local salt marsh insect communities might change with the size of larger marsh landscapes within which they are imbedded.\n",
    "Red imported fire ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) cover inaccessible surfaces with particles to facilitate food search and transportation": "Eusocial insects have evolved diverse particle-use behaviors. A previous study reported that red imported fire ants,Solenopsis invictaBuren, deposited soil particles on substances treated with essential balm, a fire ant repellent. We hypothesized thatS. invictamodifies inaccessible surfaces by covering them with soil particles to facilitate food search and transportation. Here, laboratory experiments were conducted to study the particle-covering behavior ofS. invictain response to viscose surfaces or surfaces treated with essential balm or liquid paraffin in the presence of real food (sausage) or non-food objects (acrylic plates).S. invictaworkers deposited significantly more soil particles on these three types of treated surfaces than on untreated surfaces. In addition, significantly more particles were relocated on viscose and paraffin-smeared surfaces in the presence of food than in the presence of non-food objects. The particle-covering behavior on viscose surfaces was also observed in the field. Interestingly, when no soil particles were available, ants searched and transported food on viscose surfaces only if the surfaces were artificially covered with sufficient quantities of soil particles but could not do so on viscose surfaces without soil particles or with insufficient quantities of soil particles. In addition, ants actively relocated particles to cover viscose surfaces if the transportation distance was within 200 mm, whereas significantly fewer particles were relocated at longer transportation distances (400 mm). Our study provides a novel example of particle use by fire ants during foraging.\n",
    "Isotopic and genetic methods reveal the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian host essential amino acid metabolism": "Intestinal microbiota perform many functions for their host, but among the most important is their role in metabolism, especially the conversion of recalcitrant biomass that the host is unable to digest into bioavailable compounds. Most studies have focused on the assistance gut microbiota provide in the metabolism of carbohydrates, however, their role in host amino acid metabolism is poorly understood. We conducted an experiment onMus musculususing 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbon isotope analysis of essential amino acids (AAESS) to quantify the community composition of gut microbiota and the contribution of carbohydrate carbon used by the gut microbiome to synthesize AAESSthat are assimilated by mice to build skeletal muscle tissue. The relative abundances of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes inversely varied as a function of dietary macromolecular content, with Firmicutes dominating when mice were fed low-protein diets that contained the highest proportions of simple carbohydrates (sucrose). Mixing models estimated that the microbial contribution of AAESSto mouse muscle varied from less than 5% (threonine, lysine, and phenylalanine) to approximately 60% (valine) across diet treatments, with the Firmicute-dominated microbiome associated with the greatest contribution. Our results show that intestinal microbes can provide a significant source of the AAESStheir host uses to synthesize structural tissues. The role that gut microbiota play in the amino acid metabolism of animals that consume protein-deficient diets is likely a significant but under-recognized aspect of foraging ecology and physiology.\n",
    "The Role of Education in Increasing Awareness and Reducing Impact of Natural Hazards": "Education could play a role in decreasing and mitigating damages caused by natural disaster. By analysing relationships between level of education and components of the World Risk Index, this study demonstrated an education's role in natural hazard awareness and mitigation. For this purpose, we analysed relationships between the components of WRI, created an education factor independent of WRI (based on PISA 2018 Science test results), analysed the frequency, magnitude and exposure of natural hazards of an extreme event character in selected countries and analysed the relationships between the education factor and WRI components among the countries. A detailed analysis was performed for 15 countries representing the full global range of natural hazards (frequency, magnitude and exposure to droughts, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods (not related to hurricanes), mass movements, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis) and level of education. We found that the education factor (ranked and normalised to the maximal value among the considered countries) has significant negative correlation with the following WRI parameters: the Natural Hazard Factor (relative vulnerability, based on the difference between the relative and calculated WRI, ranked and normalised to the maximal value of WRI differences), susceptibility, lack of coping capacities and lack of adaptive capacities (all ranked and normalised to the maximal value). Results indicated that countries at low risk tend to be over-aware while countries at high risk are under-aware of natural hazards. Education can significantly increase awareness of natural hazards and reduce their impact.\n",
    "Extreme ultraviolet quasar colours from GALEX observations of the SDSS DR14Q catalogue": "The rest-frame far to extreme ultraviolet (UV) colour-redshift relationship has been constructed from data on over $480\\, 000$ quasars carefully cross-matched between SDSS Data Release 14 and the final GALEX photometric catalogue. UV matching and detection probabilities are given for all the quasars, including dependencies on separation, optical brightness, and redshift. Detection limits are also provided for all objects. The UV colour distributions are skewed redward at virtually all redshifts, especially when detection limits are accounted for. The median GALEX far-UV minus near-UV (FUV - NUV) colour-redshift relation is reliably determined up to z  2.8, corresponding to rest-frame wavelengths as short as 400 A. Extreme UV (EUV) colours are substantially redder than found previously, when detection limits are properly accounted for. Quasar template spectra were forward modelled through the GALEX bandpasses, accounting for intergalactic opacity, intrinsic reddening, and continuum slope variations. Intergalactic absorption by itself cannot account for the very red EUV colours. The colour-redshift relation is consistent with no intrinsic reddening, at least for SMC-like extinction. The best model fit has a FUV continuum power-law slope an, FUV = -0.34 +- 0.03 consistent with previous results, but an EUV slope an, EUV = -2.90 +- 0.04 that is much redder and inconsistent with any previous composite value (all  -2.0). The EUV slope difference can be attributed in part to the tendency of previous studies to preferentially select UV brighter and bluer objects. The weak EUV flux suggests quasar accretion disc models that include outflows such as disc winds.\n",

    "The close binary fraction as a function of stellar parameters in APOGEE: a strong anticorrelation with a abundances": "We use observations from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey to explore the relationship between stellar parameters and multiplicity. We combine high-resolution repeat spectroscopy for 41 363 dwarf and subgiant stars with abundance measurements from the APOGEE pipeline and distances and stellar parameters derived using Gaia DR2 parallaxes from Sanders & Das to identify and characterize stellar multiples with periods below 30 yr, corresponding to DRVmax  3 km s-1, where DRVmax is the maximum APOGEE-detected shift in the radial velocities. Chemical composition is responsible for most of the variation in the close binary fraction in our sample, with stellar parameters like mass and age playing a secondary role. In addition to the previously identified strong anticorrelation between the close binary fraction and [Fe/H], we find that high abundances of a elements also suppress multiplicity at most values of [Fe/H] sampled by APOGEE. The anticorrelation between a abundances and multiplicity is substantially steeper than that observed for Fe, suggesting C, O, and Si in the form of dust and ices dominate the opacity of primordial protostellar discs and their propensity for fragmentation via gravitational stability. Near [Fe/H] = 0 dex, the bias-corrected close binary fraction (a &lt; 10 au) decreases from 100 per cent at [a/H] = -0.2 dex to 15 per cent near [a/H] = 0.08 dex, with a suggestive turn-up to 20 per cent near [a/H] = 0.2. We conclude that the relationship between stellar multiplicity and chemical composition for sun-like dwarf stars in the field of the Milky Way is complex, and that this complexity should be accounted for in future studies of interacting binaries.\n",
    "Diffraction Experiments with a Smart Cart": "The use of smartphones in experimental physics is by now widely accepted and documented. PASCO scientific's Smart Cart, in combination with student-owned smartphones and free apps, has opened a new universe of low-cost experiments that have traditionally required cumbersome and expensive equipment. In this paper, we demonstrate the simplicity, convenience, and cost-savings achieved by replacing a plethora of traditional motion sensors, wires, interface boards, and other equipment clutter with the smart cart, PASPORT(r) High Sensitivity Light Sensor, and the free SPARKvue(r) app by carrying out diffraction measurements of light with a single as well as double slit. Rylander and Miller reported a similar experiment but with an ordinary laboratory cart and a motion sensor to extract the precise position of the light sensor. The use of the smart cart in this report obviates the need for using a motion sensor and the laborious extraction of the position data.\n",
    "Predicting College Women's Self-esteem Based on Verbal Coercion Experience and Verbal Tactic Items on the Revised Sexual Experiences Survey": "Verbal coercion experience is common among college women and has sometimes been associated with lower self-esteem. The current study examined self-esteem based on the two verbal coercion items included in the latest version of the most popular measure of sexual victimization experience, the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization (SES-SFV; Koss et al., 2007 ). One item includes verbal tactics categorized as \"threat\" and the other item includes verbal tactics categorized as \"criticism.\" Undergraduate women ( n = 479) completed the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the SES-SFV. Results showed that women who experienced criticism reported lower self-esteem than those who did not experience criticism. However, threat experience was not significantly related to women's self-esteem. Findings support Koss et al.'s suggestion that criticism tactics are more negative than threat tactics, and imply that self-esteem may be negatively associated with some sexually coercive verbal tactics but not associated with others. Future researchers should pay careful attention to operational definitions of verbal coercion.\n",
    "Improving the resilience of SMEs in times of crisis: The impact of mobile money amid Covid-19 in Zambia": "This study investigates the impact of mobile money (MM) on SMEs' resilience and the associated business outcome in developing countries amid Covid-19. Despite the potential of MM to improve SMEs' resilience, little evidence has been documented. Using Enterprise Survey data in Zambia, we show that SMEs are more likely than large firms to experience catastrophic sales decline, reflecting their inherent vulnerability. Further analysis reveals that this unfavourable effect can be effectively counteracted when SMEs incorporate MM into daily business. An important policy implication is that the use of digital technologies should be a key element of policy responses to Covid-19.\n",
    "Backward-Design Model for an Astronomy Course Using RSpec": "The new normal imposed on us by the COVID-19 pandemic restricted the traditional ways we would teach high school students who are eager to participate in introductory astronomy projects on our university campus. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise as we were forced to come up with creative ways to get around this obstacle. The outcome is an outline of a pedagogically sound and even more robust instructional plan for an astronomy course using RSpec in conjunction with freely available databases. In addition to the traditional topics, the new model will allow an instructor to explore emission lines of variable Be stars like Gamma Cas and the classification of supernovae by an interpretation of their spectra. We argue that this new model should be used even if we return to the old normal.\n",

    "Resilience, Psychological Distress, and Academic Burnout among Accounting Students*": "This study's objective is to examine the role of resilience in the dynamic between academic burnout and psychological distress using a sample of US undergraduate accounting majors. It extends prior research--that is, Garcia-Izquierdo et al. (2018), who examine these relationships using a sample of Spanish nursing students. For this study, a survey instrument was concurrently administered to 443 accounting majors at four geographically dispersed universities. Two alternative models are tested. The first model positions resilience as an exogenous predictor, and dimensions of academic burnout antecedent to psychological distress. The results indicate a significant negative association between resilience, psychological distress, and each of the three academic burnout dimensions. In addition, emotional exhaustion and academic inefficacy have a significant positive association with psychological distress. The alternative model positions psychological distress antecedent to each of the academic burnout dimensions. The results indicate that resilience has a significant negative association with psychological distress, cynicism, and academic inefficacy, but not emotional exhaustion. Moreover, psychological distress has significant positive associations with each academic burnout dimension. In the alternative model specification, resilience is also found to moderate the association between psychological distress and academic inefficacy. This single moderating effect notwithstanding, the findings suggest that the primary role of resilience is that of a compensatory mechanism by acting as an independent exogenous predictor of distress and burnout.\n",
    "How Trust in Information Sources Influences Preventative Measures Compliance during the COVID-19 Pandemic": "This paper explores how trust in formal information sources (government and media) and informal information sources (interpersonal) about COVID-19 influences compliance with preventive measures. This cross-sectional study uses convenience sampling of 478 adult participants. Data analyses using structural equation modeling with multigroup comparisons examine hypothesized relationships between trust in information sources and preventative behaviors and social distancing. Results suggest that understanding of COVID-19 causes is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to trust in informal information. Self-efficacy for prevention is related to trust in informal information sources, but not to trust in formal information sources. Worry about contracting COVID-19 is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to informal ones. Engaging in preventive measures is linked to both self-efficacy for prevention and worry, while social distancing was related only to worry. These findings have important implications for public health policy guidelines centered on clear and truthful media messages. The findings also facilitate comparative analyses of reactions to information sources across a decade of evolving attitudes toward media and government, between two cultures (Hong Kong vs. the USA), and between two different global pandemics.\n",
    "Caregiving in quarantine: Humor styles, reframing, and psychological well-being among parents of children with disabilities": "Prior research links adaptive humor styles (affiliative and self-enhancing) with enhanced psychological well-being and maladaptive humor styles (aggressive and self-defeating) with worse psychological well-being, primarily through humor styles' influence on individuals' social interactions and efforts to positively reframe stressors. The present study examined the unique relation of each humor style with psychological well-being with a focus on understanding mechanisms of adjustment under highly stressful conditions. Ninety-nine parents of children with disabilities were surveyed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States in March 2020, and 79 parents completed follow-up surveys in July 2020. As predicted, at T1, self-enhancing humor was associated with less psychological distress and greater family satisfaction, self-defeating humor was associated with greater distress, and aggressive humor was associated with lower family satisfaction. Moreover, affiliative humor predicted decreased psychological distress over time, whereas self-defeating humor predicted increased psychological distress and decreased family satisfaction over time. Relations were largely mediated by caregiver positive reappraisal, family efforts to reframe daily disability-related challenges, and negative social interactions. Future research should further examine the influence of caregiver humor styles on family dynamics, family reframing norms, and caregiving efficacy.\n",
    "Predicting Body-Esteem Based on Type of Sexual Victimization Experience": "Almost no research exists examining the relationship between body-esteem and sexual victimization experience in adulthood. The current study contributes to the literature by examining body-esteem based on type of sexual victimization experience (i.e., none, sexual contact, attempted sexual coercion, sexual coercion, attempted rape, rape). Participants included undergraduate women ( n = 750) who completed the Body-Esteem Scale ( Franzoi & Shields, 1984 ) and the Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization ( Koss et al., 2007 ), and had either no history of sexual victimization experience or experience within the past year. Women with no sexual victimization experience did not differ from women with sexual contact experience, but both groups reported higher body-esteem than women with coercion, attempted coercion, and rape experience. These three latter groups did not differ from one another, but each reported lower body-esteem than women with attempted rape experience, who reported higher body-esteem than those with no experience. Findings are preliminary but suggest that body-esteem may be negatively associated with some types of sexual victimization experience (attempted and completed coercion, rape), but not others (sexual contact, attempted rape), and escaping rape may increase positive feelings toward one's body.\n",
    "A Massive Open Online Course to Educate Healthcare Professionals & Caregivers About Alzheimer's Disease": "Over 6 million Americans and 50 million persons worldwide are estimated to have Alzheimer's disease (AD) as it remains the major cause of dementia in the older adult population. Both healthcare professionals and family caregivers struggle with the complexities of caring for individuals with this progressive neurological disease. To address the ongoing knowledge and care gap regarding Alzheimer's disease among both healthcare professionals and family caregivers, a comprehensive massive open online course (MOOC) was developed and made available via the edX platform. MOOCs are open access and interactive courses offered via the web; they have emerged as a popular, self-paced mode of distance learning. Launched in 2020, the MOOC titled, Alzheimer's Disease & Dementia Care, consists of five modules reviewing symptoms, diagnosis, medications, communication and care tips, as well as a module outlining special considerations when the person with AD is hospitalized. While this educational strategy targets healthcare professionals (such as nurses, physical therapists and related practitioners), it is also designed for lay caregivers or anyone who wants to learn more the disease. The course utilizes a variety of teaching modalities and is free. To date over 7000 persons have enrolled from over 140 countries. MOOCs remain an innovative and engaging educational strategy to reach a global audience. More importantly, they can serve as an another outlet to enhance both the competence and confidence of both healthcare professionals and family caregivers by sharing best practices in caring for those with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.\n",
    "The effect of regulation-driven trade barriers and governance quality on export entrepreneurship": "This paper examines the impact of regulation-driven trade barriers on export entrepreneurship in a panel of 60 countries between 2006 and 2014. The paper finds robust evidence that unfavorable trade regulations significantly reduce export entry rate and export entry density (two critical measures of export entrepreneurship) by increasing the time and cost associated with documentary and customs compliance procedures. These findings support the hypothesis that less conducive business regulations are an important domestic supply constraint which impedes export entrepreneurship by increasing trade costs. In addition, the paper finds that the magnitude of the negative relationship between export entrepreneurship and regulation-driven trade barriers is significantly more pronounced in countries with poor governance quality. Two measures of governance quality (i.e., political stability and rule of law) are shown to be relatively more significant in aiding favorable trade regulations that promote export entrepreneurship. Furthermore, a reduction in regulation-driven trade barriers has a positive impact on net entry rate and survival rates of first-, second- and third-year exporters, and high-quality governance institutions significantly increase the magnitude of this positive relationship.\n",
    "Tournament incentives and performance: Evidence from the WNBA": "Players entering the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) are allocated to teams based on a draft where lower performing teams in the regular season earn the highest odds of selecting the best players, creating an incentive for teams to lose games. Using data from the 2000-2019 seasons, results indicate that WNBA teams are more likely to lose after they have been eliminated from postseason playoffs regardless of the gender of the coach or general manager. Evidence of tanking is concentrated in seasons after the WNBA made a draft lottery change in 2015, which was intended to reduce tanking.\n",
    "\"He just teaches whatever he thinks is important\": Analysis of comments in student evaluations of teaching": "Student evaluations of teaching are ubiquitous in higher education; however, most prior research has focused on the numeric ratings, with little systematic attention given to the qualitative comments. In this study, written comments were collected as part of the regular evaluation of a community health nursing course over four semesters. Taken as a whole, student comments were strikingly consistent and mostly negative. Students emphasized the authority of the textbook and framed the course as preparation for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX). Instructor efforts to focus on critical analysis of social issues were met with confusion, suspicion, and resistance. Student comments were further analyzed in relation to 3 levels of discourse: the student/teacher level, the nursing-education level, and the social-historical level. For each level, the comments reveal problems, but not the ones suggested by a conventional reading of student evaluations. If students and teachers have conflicting expectations about goals and methods for learning, formal student evaluations may be less useful as a measure of teaching effectiveness. This study also raises troubling concerns about current practices in nursing pedagogy, particularly the emphasis on standardized testing and highly structured didactics, and the overlap between student evaluation systems and the technologies of neoliberalism.\n",
    "Employment and output effects of federal regulations on small business": "This paper examines the disparate impact of US federal regulations on small businesses. Using a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model, we obtained two implications of higher regulation on small firms that have yet to be empirically tested in the published literature. First, as regulations increase, small firms' share of employment shrinks. Second, as regulations rise, small firms' share of total output falls. Using a panel of industry-specific US regulatory restrictions, we found that a 10% increase in federal regulations was associated with an approximate 0.8% reduction in small firms' share of industry employment and a nearly 1.5% decline in small firms' share of industry output.\n",
    "The Compensation Benefit of ITIL(r) Skills and Certifications": "Information Technology Service Management (ITSM) is a quality management approach for managing IT services that meet business needs. The most broadly accepted ITSM framework is ITIL(r) (Mann, 2012) and its adoption by organizations across the globe has grown over the past decade. A study conducted by Forrester and itSMF (2013) found that IT service providers that employ ITIL(r) enjoy better service quality and higher operational productivity as well as cost savings. Therefore, IT professionals with ITIL(r) knowledge and skills are likely valuable to organizations and earn a higher wage than their peers. This paper investigates whether or not there are salary benefits for IT professionals that possess ITIL(r) knowledge and skill and what are the estimated benefits, if any. Using a human capital model and employing data from an on-line survey of a large set of IT professionals (16,632 responses) conducted at the end of 2013 this benefit is confirmed and quantified.\n",
    "Making Sense of Methods: What Does Systematic and Intentional Practitioner Research Look Like?": "The purpose of this study is to understand what empirical practitioner research looks like, specifically to document and describe the methodological qualities of it. The author used content analysis to examine 74 accounts of practitioner's systematic and intentional inquiry in literacy contexts. Findings offer evidence that can enhance the credibility of empirical practitioner research. For example, practitioner researchers often being their inquiry with a research question or goal, are more likely than not to identify a research design, tend to collect multiple sources of data, and analyze the data in appropriate ways. Less common was attention to trustworthiness considerations. The paper concludes with recommendations for strengthening the methodological credibility for this type of inquiry and for viewing practitioners as creators of knowledge.\n",
    "Sex differences in social odor discrimination by southern giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei)": "Rodents are known to signal using odors to communicate information including their sex, age, reproductive state, and unique identity. Conspecifics can recognize these signals and behaviorally respond in sex-specific ways. However, we know little about how males and females might differ in their responses to signals from individuals or how the sexes might differ in their ability to recognize their own identity. Such signals of identity are important because they can modulate the behavior of receivers, and allow for responses related to aggression, territory maintenance, affiliation, and reproduction. To assess how males and females might differ in their responses to individual familiar and novel social signals, and their own individual signals compared to novel same-sex conspecifics, we tested southern giant pouched rats (Cricetomys ansorgei) using a habituation-discrimination paradigm. Only females showed individual recognition and discriminated among males, preferring novel males. Females also discriminated between their own scent and a novel conspecific odor. Males did not discriminate or demonstrate individual recognition. Male and female differences in response to opposite-sex odors demonstrated that males do not discriminate between familiar and novel reproductively available females, but females discriminate and prefer to investigate novel males.\n",
    "Federal Regulation and Mortality in the 50 States": "Previous research speculates that some regulations are counterproductive in the sense that they increase (rather than decrease) mortality risk. However, few empirical studies have measured the extent to which this phenomenon holds across the regulatory system as a whole. Using a novel U.S. state panel data set spanning the period 2000-2014, we estimate the effect of U.S. federal regulation on state-level mortality. We find that a 1% increase in federal regulation of state economies is associated with an increase in an index of state mortality of between 0.53% and 1.35%. These findings are robust to the form of mortality measure, choice of covariates, and the inclusion/exclusion of various regions, states, and industries. We also provide an update of the \"cost-per-life saved cutoff,\" which is the counterproductive risk threshold for expenditures. We find that expenditures in excess of $38.6 million (2019 dollars) per life saved can be expected to increase mortality risk. This article fills an important gap in the empirical literature and boosts the credibility of mortality risk analysis, whereby public policymakers weigh both the expected lives saved and lost due to a proposed regulation or other policy.\n",
    "Managing the adverse effect of supply chain risk on corporate reputation: The mediating role of corporate social responsibility practices": "Within the last decade, research has focussed on corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices as a strategic tool that enables firms to improve stakeholder perception, brand image and corporate reputation. However, one area that remains understudied is the role played by CSR practices in managing corporate reputation under conditions of supply chain risk. To answer this research question, we conduct a literature review and develop the corresponding hypothesis. We test our hypothesis using quantitative analysis of both primary and secondary data collected from organizations dispersed globally. The results highlight that under conditions of supply chain network disruption risk, CSR practices play an important role in enabling firms to manage the negative impact of such risk drivers on corporate reputation. The study further suggests that CSR practices positively impact supply chain risk management (SCRM) practices and are a necessary condition for SCRM practices to be effective in improving corporate reputation of organizations.\n",
    "Hearing and Teaching Soundtracks as a Mother and a Daughter": "This chapter analyzes embodied listening from a pedagogical and unusually personal, feminist point-of-view. It explores how two parts of the author's identity (being a mother, and being a daughter whose mother died) teach her to hear cinema anew along with her students. By extension, it builds upon other sound scholarship (especially the work of Michel Chion), by stressing that every person's experiences leads them to rehear all cinema with meaningful results. In this chapter, the author first draws from her experiences of motherhood while teaching the sound track of Babies (2010). Second, she reflects on witnessing her mother's death in relation to teaching the sound track of a death scene from Ten Canoes (2006). Third, the author connects being in the presence of her mother's silent body with teaching a conversation from An Examined Life (2008), featuring queer theorist Judith Butler and disabled artist-activist Sunara Taylor.\n",
    "Multilingualism, Chronotopes, and Resolutions: Toward an Analysis of the Total Sociolinguistic Fact": "In this article, I argue for a chronotopic-scalar system of images and resolutions in the analysis of language use in general and multilingual practices in particular. Drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijanis, I argue that availability and accessibility of linguistic/semiotic resources, and their categorizations as languages or language varieties, are constrained by participants' chronotopization histories. That is, the scaled images participants develop through socialization about different time-space frames and the peoples, relations, discourses, and resources therein guide their language use both from and about particular contexts. I discuss the utility of spatiotemporal understandings of repertoires of resources and normalcies in capturing the variability, dynamicity, and complexity of semiotic practices and also in addressing the controversies among scholars regarding the 'realness' of languages and hybridity of multilingual practices. Through decentralizing language(s) and foregrounding context(s) and contextualization, I argue, the chronotope enables us to analyze not only social actors' hybrid utilization of semiotic resources in meaning-making processes, but also their language ideologies and language-ideological practices, which rely heavily on the perceptions of languages as discrete systems.\n",
    "When Internships Go Virtual": "In early 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic ravaged countries across the world, causing them to essentially shut down. Communities had to retreat indoors and socially distance from one another. One aspect of life that drastically changed was schooling. It moved from traditional face-to-face spaces to online digital platforms. Students, faculty, and staff across all levels of schooling shifted to teaching and learning vis-a-vis online digital platforms. Those of us connected to the training of the next generation of teachers navigated through the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic at the preschool to post-secondary levels as well. This chapter focuses on the authors' experiences as a Black university supervisor and as a Black field placement coordinator.\n",
    "How many regulations does it take to get a beer? The geography of beer regulations": "Although the influence of regulations on economic outcomes has been well documented, few studies have focused on the geography of regulatory burdens. The regulations confronting any supply chain can vary dramatically across legislative jurisdictions, as U.S. policy is enforced by overlapping federal, state, and local governments. We use a unique data set to explore state-by-state regulatory variation in U.S. beer supply chains in 2020. We find that the state-level rules targeted at the beer supply chain vary between 1,177 and 25,399, with the average state implementing 10,212 formal regulatory restrictions.\n",
    "When do Mangroves Create an Economic \"Safe Haven\" from Tropical Storms?": "Evidence suggests that climate change will increase the frequency of intense storms. Mangroves may protect economic activity in coastal areas. We develop a model that illustrates protections from mangroves and coastal elevation and estimate the impacts of cyclones on coastal economic activity. We find that higher elevation or expansive mangroves alone shelter economic activity from \"indirect\" cyclone exposure whereas economic activity is only protected from \"direct\" cyclone exposure in high elevation communities with expansive mangroves. Our global mapping reveals that the majority of these \"safe havens\" are in upper middle-income countries but are used by populations in lower middle-income countries.\n",
    "Borders: An International Comparative Analysis of Social Work's Response": "Borders play a profound role in human life. In many settings, land borders are highly permeable and provide little barrier to movement, communication and interaction. In other circumstances, borders are highly rigid, difficult to cross and can demarcate vast economic and social disparities. The widely differing circumstances related to border creation and maintenance have deep effects that are worthy of social work attention and engagement. There has been serious attention to issues of globalisation, immigration and human rights in the social work literature. Our focus on borders is related to, but distinct from these issues, and therefore, has something unique to offer. Increased globalisation has led to a major reconceptualisation in our understanding of borders. The COVID-19 epidemic demonstrates the limited relevance of borders in some circumstances (spreading of the virus) but the heightened relevance of borders in other circumstances (travel restrictions). Social work practitioners have a role in framing the understanding of borders and resulting policies. Our focus is to address the question: How has social work engaged with border issues? We examine three international cases and conduct a comparative analysis to examine similarities and differences. From the analysis, we draw conclusions to further understanding for social work.\n",
    "Physical Activity Levels in Six Native American Communities Using the FITT-VP Approach": "## Purpose:\nThis study aimed to describe physical activity (PA) via the frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, and progression (FITT-VP) principles of Native Americans (NA), it is necessary to understand their current PA. The purpose was to 1) evaluate PA levels utilizing FITT-VP principles and 2) compare the patterns of PA in NA men and women.\n\n## Methods:\nRecruitment and evaluation (n= 586) took place as part of the OPREVENT2 study baseline evaluation. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form assessed frequency (days per week), intensity (walking, moderate, vigorous), and time (minutes per day). The total MET-minutes for the previous 7 d provided the volume of activity.\n\n## Results:\nThe NA sample was 45.8 +- 15.1 yr of age, with a body mass index of 31.5 +- 6.4 kg*m-2. The FIT-V corresponded to 4.7 +- 2.3 d*wk-1, walking (3.3 METs intensity), 52 +- 47 min*d-1, and 2536 +- 2203 MET*min-1. The men (n= 162) reported a greater frequency of 3.2 +- 2.5 d*wk-1(P= 0.007) of vigorous activity lasting 55 +- 50 min*d-1compared with the women (n= 433) with 2.6 +- 2.5 d*wk-1of vigorous activity lasting 34 +- 38 min*d-1. The men reported higher MET-minutes than did the women (P= 0.0001). Overall, 71% of men and 77% of women met the recommended PA guidelines.\n\n## Conclusions:\nGiven that the majority of NA report adequate walking time and frequency, interventions are needed to improve moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic fitness, as well as muscular strength and endurance, neuromotor, and flexibility activities.\n",
    "Early Findings of a Study Exploring the Social Media, Political and Cultural Awareness, and Civic Activism of Gen Z Students in the Mid-Atlantic United States [Abstract]": "Aim/Purpose: This paper provides the results of the preliminary analysis of the findings of an ongoing study that seeks to examine the social media use, cultural and political awareness, civic engagement, issue prioritization, and social activism of Gen Z students enrolled at four different institutional types located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The aim of this study is to look at the group as a whole as well as compare findings across populations. The institutional types under consideration include a mid-sized majority serving or otherwise referred to as a traditionally white institution (TWI) located in a small coastal city on the Atlantic Ocean, a small Historically Black University (HBCU) located in a rural area, a large community college located in a county that is a mixture of rural and suburban and which sits on the border of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and graduating high school students enrolled in career and technical education (CTE) programs in a large urban area. This exploration is purposed to examine the behaviors and expectations of Gen Z students within a representative American region during a time of tremendous turmoil and civil unrest in the United States.\n\nBackground: Over 74 million strong, Gen Z makes up almost one-quarter of the U.S. population. They already outnumber any current living generation and are the first true digital natives. Born after 1996 and through 2012, they are known for their short attention spans and heightened ability to multi-task. Raised in the age of the smart phone, they have been tethered to digital devices from a young age with most having the preponderance of their childhood milestones commemorated online. Often called Zoomers, they are more racially and ethnically diverse than any previous generation and are on track to be the most well-educated generation in history. Gen Zers in the United States have been found in the research to be progressive and pro-government and viewing increasing racial and ethnic diversity as positive change. Finally, they are less likely to hold xenophobic beliefs such as the notion of American exceptionalism and superiority that have been popular with by prior generations.\nThe United States has been in a period of social and civil unrest in recent years with concerns over systematic racism, rampant inequalities, political polarization, xenophobia, police violence, sexual assault and harassment, and the growing epidemic of gun violence. Anxieties stirred by the COVID-19 pandemic further compounded these issues resulting in a powder keg explosion occurring throughout the summer of 2020 and leading well into 2021. As a result, the United States has deteriorated significantly in the Civil Unrest Index falling from 91st to 34th. \nThe vitriol, polarization, protests, murders, and shootings have all occurred during Gen Z's formative years, and the limited research available indicates that it has shaped their values and political views.\n\nMethodology: The Mid-Atlantic region is a portion of the United States that exists as the overlap between the northeastern and southeastern portions of the country. It includes the nation's capital, as well as large urban centers, small cities, suburbs, and rural enclaves. It is one of the most socially, economically, racially, and culturally diverse parts of the United States and is often referred to as the \"typically American region.\" \nAn electronic survey was administered to students from 2019 through 2021 attending a high school dual enrollment program, a minority serving institution, a majority serving institution, and a community college all located within the larger mid-Atlantic region. The survey included a combination of multiple response, Likert scaled, dichotomous, open ended, and ordinal questions. It was developed in the Survey Monkey system and reviewed by several content and methodological experts in order to examine bias, vagueness, or potential semantic problems. Finally, the survey was pilot tested prior to implementation in order to explore the efficacy of the research methodology. It was then modified accordingly prior to widespread distribution to potential participants.\nThe surveys were administered to students enrolled in classes taught by the authors all of whom are educators. Participation was voluntary, optional, and anonymous. Over 800 individuals completed the survey with just over 700 usable results, after partial completes and the responses of individuals outside of the 18-24 age range were removed. \n\nFindings: Participants in this study overwhelmingly were users of social media. In descending order, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Tik Tok were the most popular social media services reported as being used. When volume of use was considered, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Twitter were the most cited with most participants reporting using Instagram and Snapchat multiple times a day.\nWhen asked to select which social media service they would use if forced to choose just one, the number one choice was YouTube followed by Instagram and Snapchat. Additionally, more than half of participants responded that they have uploaded a video to a video sharing site such as YouTube or Tik Tok. \nWhen asked about their familiarity with different technologies, participants overwhelmingly responded that they are \"very familiar\" with smart phones, searching the Web, social media, and email. About half the respondents said that they were \"very familiar\" with common computer applications such as the Microsoft Office Suite or Google Suite with another third saying that they were \"somewhat familiar.\" When asked about Learning Management Systems (LMS) like Blackboard, Course Compass, Canvas, Edmodo, Moodle, Course Sites, Google Classroom, Mindtap, Schoology, Absorb, D2L, itslearning, Otus, PowerSchool, or WizIQ, only 43% said they were \"very familiar\" with 31% responding that they were \"somewhat familiar.\" Finally, about half the students were either \"very\" or \"somewhat\" familiar with operating systems such as Windows.\nA few preferences with respect to technology in the teaching and learning process were explored in the survey. Most students (85%) responded that they want course announcements and reminders sent to their phones, 76% expect their courses to incorporate the use of technology, 71% want their courses to have course websites, and 71% said that they would rather watch a video than read a book chapter. \nWhen asked to consider the future, over 81% or respondents reported that technology will play a major role in their future career. \nMost participants considered themselves \"informed\" or \"well informed\" about current events although few considered themselves \"very informed\" or \"well informed\" about politics. When asked how they get their news, the most common forum reported for getting news and information about current events and politics was social media with 81% of respondents reporting. \nGen Z is known to be an engaged generation and the participants in this study were not an exception. As such, it came as no surprise to discover that, in the past year more than 78% of respondents had educated friends or family about an important social or political issue, about half (48%) had donated to a cause of importance to them, more than a quarter (26%) had participated in a march or rally, and a quarter (26%) had actively boycotted a product or company. Further, about 37% consider themselves to be a social activist with another 41% responding that aren't sure if they would consider themselves an activist and only 22% saying that they would not consider themselves an activist.\nWhen asked what issues were important to them, the most frequently cited were Black Lives Matter (75%), human trafficking (68%), sexual assault/harassment/Me Too (66.49%), gun violence (65.82%), women's rights (65.15%), climate change (55.4%), immigration reform/deferred action for childhood arrivals (DACA) (48.8%), and LGBTQ+ rights (47.39%).\nWhen the schools were compared, there were only minor differences in social media use with the high school students indicating slightly more use of Tik Tok than the other participants. All groups were virtually equal when it came to how informed they perceived themselves about current events and politics. Consensus among groups existed with respect to how they get their news, and the community college and high school students were slightly more likely to have participated in a march, protest, or rally in the last 12 months than the university students. The community college and high school students were also slightly more likely to consider themselves social activists than the participants from either of the universities.  \nWhen the importance of the issues was considered, significant differences based on institutional type were noted. \nBlack Lives Matter (BLM) was identified as important by the largest portion of students attending the HBCU followed by the community college students and high school students. Less than half of the students attending the TWI considered BLM an important issue. Human trafficking was cited as important by a higher percentage of students attending the HBCU and urban high school than at the suburban and rural community college or the TWI. Sexual assault was considered important by the majority of students at all the schools with the percentage a bit smaller from the majority serving institution. About two thirds of the students at the high school, community college, and HBCU considered gun violence important versus about half the students at the majority serving institution. Women's rights were reported as being important by more of the high school and HBCU participants than the community college or TWI. Climate change was considered important by about half the students at all schools with a slightly smaller portion reporting out the HBCU. Immigration reform/DACA was reported as important by half the high school, community college, and HBCU participants with only a third of the students from the majority serving institution citing it as an important issue. With respect to LGBTQ rights approximately half of the high school and community college participants cited it as important, 44.53% of the HBCU students, and only about a quarter of the students attending the majority serving institution.   \n\nContribution and Conclusion: This paper provides a timely investigation into the mindset of generation Z students living in the United States during a period of heightened civic unrest. This insight is useful to educators who should be informed about the generation of students that is currently populating higher education. \nThe findings of this study are consistent with public opinion polls by Pew Research Center. According to the findings, the Gen Z students participating in this study are heavy users of multiple social media, expect technology to be integrated into teaching and learning, anticipate a future career where technology will play an important role, informed about current and political events, use social media as their main source for getting news and information, and fairly engaged in social activism. When institutional type was compared the students from the university with the more affluent and less diverse population were less likely to find social justice issues important than the other groups.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: During disruptive and contentious times, it is negligent to think that the abounding issues plaguing society are not important to our students. Gauging the issues of importance and levels of civic engagement provides us crucial information towards understanding the attitudes of students. Further, knowing how our students gain information, their social media usage, as well as how informed they are about current events and political issues can be used to more effectively communicate and educate.\n\nRecommendations for Researchers: As social media continues to proliferate daily life and become a vital means of news and information gathering, additional studies such as the one presented here are needed. Additionally, in other countries facing similarly turbulent times, measuring student interest, awareness, and engagement is highly informative.\n\nImpact on Society: During a highly contentious period replete with a large volume of civil unrest and compounded by a global pandemic, understanding the behaviors and attitudes of students can help us as higher education faculty be more attuned when it comes to the design and delivery of curriculum.\nFuture Research\tThis presentation presents preliminary findings. Data is still being collected and much more extensive statistical analyses will be performed.\n",
    "Beyond Social Distance": "COVID-19 forced abrupt shifts to e-learning, deepened an existing digital divide at a mid-Atlantic Historically Black College/University (HBCU), and exacerbated perennial inequity issues at HBCUs. The campus community was ill-prepared to navigate remotely due to unreliable internet service, insufficient technology, and shared spaces that were not optimal for teaching and learning. Work-life imbalances threatened the well-being of students, staff, and faculty who struggled to meet academic and professional demands amid homeschooling, caregiving, and coping with COVID-19 fatalities. By contrast, the pandemic inspired creative teaching, galvanized and humanized the campus, and evoked resilience. This chapter illuminates disparities and celebrates triumphs of HBCUs, including factors that shielded the author's university from further hardship. Readers will think critically about culturally responsive strategies to address socioeconomic and digital inequities and ensure that HBCUs are poised to meet campus needs during major crises.\n",
    "Covariation among multimodal components in the courtship display of the tungara frog": "Communication systems often include a variety of components, including those that span modalities, which may facilitate detection and decision-making. For example, female tungara frogs and fringe-lipped bats generally rely on acoustic mating signals to find male tungara frogs in a mating or foraging context, respectively. However, two additional cues (vocal sac inflation and water ripples) can enhance detection and choice behavior. To date, we do not know the natural variation and covariation of these three components. To address this, we made detailed recordings of calling males, including call amplitude, vocal sac volume and water ripple height, in 54 frogs (2430 calls). We found that all three measures correlated, with the strongest association between the vocal sac volume and call amplitude. We also found that multimodal models predicted the mass of calling males better than unimodal models. These results demonstrate how multimodal components of a communication system relate to each other and provide an important foundation for future studies on how receivers integrate and compare complex displays.\n",
    "Self-Leadership and Psychological Capital as Key Cognitive Resources for Shaping Health-Protective Behaviors during the COVID-19 Pandemic": "As COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, health researchers and practitioners have focused attention on identifying the factors that may help to shape health-protective behaviors, protecting individual health and well-being, and helping to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This study explores the potential role of self-leadership and psychological capital (PsyCap) as key cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors. Using multiple theoretical frameworks (social cognitive theory, psychological resources theory, and the health belief model), this paper develops and tests a hypothesized serial mediation model in which PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors including hand washing, wearing face masks, and social distancing. Results suggest that PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the positive relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors. These results yield valuable insights regarding the usefulness of self-leadership and PsyCap as cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors and for possible self-leadership and PsyCap interventions, potentially tailored to at-risk populations, which should have practical benefits for both the current and future pandemics and health crises.\n",
    "Emotional intelligence and servant leadership: A meta-analytic review": "Servant leadership is an effective leadership style that focuses on ethics and morality. Emotional intelligence (EI) is also associated with effective leadership and ethical behavior; thus, there has been a surge in studies that assessed the link between EI and servant leadership. Nevertheless, the empirical landscape of this relationship is mixed and fragmented. We undertook a meta-analysis to clarify this literature and found that (a) EI has a significant positive relationship with servant leadership (r = .57); (b) the relationship between EI and servant leadership is stronger in studies having a lower percentage of well-educated subjects, in low power distance cultures, and in high institutional collectivism cultures; and (c) We were unable to find sufficient evidence to support moderating effects of the relationship between EI and servant leadership for gender (male-dominated and female-dominated studies), age (between young and old subjects), for self-report versus follower-report of servant leadership, and across different scales of servant leadership.\n",
    "The role of hunting onSapajus xanthosternos'landscape of fear in the Atlantic Forest, Brazil": "Habitats with spatial variation in food availability, predation risk, and hunting pressure allow us to study how animals resolve the trade-off between food searching and predator avoidance. We investigated the influence of food availability, predation risk, and the perceived predation risk on habitat use by a primate living under high hunting pressure, the yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys,Sapajus xanthosternos, at Una Biological Reserve (ReBio Una). We hypothesized that the hunting pressure occurring in the capuchins' home range would favor predator avoidance to the detriment of searching for food. We characterized a set of covariates related to resource availability (fruit and invertebrate biomasses, feeding on dispersed and clumped food items, sleeping sites), perceived predation risk (alarm calls given to terrestrial and aerial predators, silent group movement, and vigilance behavior), and actual predation risk (evidence of hunting) and estimated their effects on how one group of capuchin monkeys uses its habitat. The group divides its time among three major forest types within their home range: agroforest, mature, and secondary. Our results suggest that the actual and perceived risk of hunting by humans, as well as the perceived predation risk by both terrestrial and aerial predators, were significant determinants of capuchin monkeys' space use. Yellow-breasted capuchin monkeys' space use was negatively related to the risk of hunting by humans (actual evidence and silent behavior), the perceived risk of predation by both aerial and terrestrial predators, and the presence of sleeping sites. Capuchin monkeys' use of space was not related to the biomass of fruits in the habitat, and the biomass of invertebrates had a very low positive effect. We confirmed our prediction that in a habitat with high hunting pressure, the risk of predation, both perceived and actual, had a more significant impact on how yellow-breasted capuchins used space than did food availability.\n",
    "The Effect of Aerobic Exercise on Metabolic Parameters of Patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis": "Many studies have investigated the effect of aerobic exercise on factors associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Aerobic exercise is an essential component in the management and treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The aim of this study was to determine and evaluate the effect of aerobic exercise on fasting blood glucose, Insulin, Insulin resistance, Glycosylated hemoglobin (Hemoglobin A1C), Lipid profile as important indicators of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Methods:This research is a systematic review and meta-analysis that was conducted in 2021. For the present study, databases, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, science of Web, SID, Magiran and Google Scholar from 2010 to 2021, were searched along with keywords. After the initial screening, the full text of the articles was evaluated and the articles that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. A total of 120 articles were reviewed, of which 16 articles met the criteria for entering the systematic review and meta-analysis. Accordingly, 710 people with fatty liver disease were divided into two groups of control and experimental group of 307 and 403 people, respectively. The mean age of the subjects in the present study was 52+-10 years. The intervention effects were evaluated using the mean difference (MD) and the random effects model. Data were analyzed using effect size tests, bias analysis and heterogeneity analysis and by STATA software.Results:Meta-analysis results indicated that endurance training in general significantly reduced glucose levels (P = 0.004, SDM = -0.26, SE = 0.09), insulin (P = 0.01, SDM = -0.29, SE = 0.11), HOMA-IR (P = 0.01, SDM = -0.28, SE = 0.11), Hba1c (P = 0.001, SDM = -0.33, SE = 0.12), triglycerides (P = 0.02, SDM = -0.31, SE = 0.13) and LDL (P = 0.03, SDM = -0.21, SE = 0.1). The results of meta-analysis did not show a significant effect on HDL levels after aerobic exercise in patients with fatty liver (P = 0.97, SDM = 0, SE = 0.09).Conclusion:Endurance training improves the levels of glucose, insulin, Hba1c, Homa-IR, triglyceride, and LDL; although, there was no significant change in HDL levels due to endurance training. However, there is still a need for more and higher quality research in this area.\n",
    "Red Imported Fire Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) Cover the Insecticide-Treated Surfaces with Particles to Reduce Contact Toxicity": "Surface treatment is commonly used in controlling the red imported fire ants,Solenopsis invictaBuren. In the present study, the behavioral responses ofS. invictaworkers to surfaces treated with insecticides were investigated. Toxicological tests showed that beta-cypermethrin had the highest contact toxicity (with the lowest LC50value) among nine tested insecticides, followed by thiamethoxam, fipronil, indoxacarb, chlorfenapyr, rotenone, spinetoram, avermectin, and chlorantraniliprole. In the laboratory, surfaces treated beta-cypermethrin or rotenone significantly reduced the number of foraging ants. In addition,S. invictaworkers transported significantly more particles (measured in weight and/or covered area) onto surfaces treated with fipronil (50, 500, and 5000 ppm), rotenone (5000 ppm), or avermectin (5000 ppm) compared with the controls. Similarly, these insecticides significantly triggered the particle-covering behavior of ants in the field. We hypothesized that such behaviors would reduce the contact toxicity of insecticides againstS. invicta.When the surfaces treated with fipronil or rotenone (500 or 5000 ppm) were artificiality covered with particles,S. invictahad significantly higher LT50values compared with insecticide-treated surfaces without particles.This study provides the first evidence thatS. invictaworkers can perform particle-covering behavior to reduce the toxicity of certain insecticides, which constitutes a unique insecticide-resistance strategy in ants.\n",
    "K-2 principal knowledge (not leadership) matters for dyslexia intervention": "Kindergarten through second-grade elementary schools that best serve students with dyslexia have principals who are knowledgeable about dyslexia and understand the best practices for providing intervention for students with dyslexia. In this study, three styles of leadership were examined to understand the implication that leadership has on intervention for dyslexia: transformational, instructional, and integrated leadership. However, many students in elementary schools have difficulty learning to read despite good leadership by the principal, with 5-20% of students being diagnosed with dyslexia. While these students need phonetic, multisensory intervention to build necessary reading skills, this study found that many principals lack knowledge of this specialized instruction. The purpose of this research was to explore variables that determine the school-based level of appropriate intervention for students with dyslexia. A questionnaire assessing leadership skills, knowledge, and beliefs about dyslexia, preparation in reading disorders and/or dyslexia received from degree programs and professional development, and services provided to students with dyslexia was given to K-2 principals serving in schools across the United States. Results indicated that regardless of leadership style, principals who have greater knowledge and more correct beliefs about dyslexia provide more appropriate school-based services for students with dyslexia. Eight detailed K-2 principal/practitioner recommendations are included based upon this key finding.\n",
    "LAX-Score": "For the past several decades, machine learning has played an important role in sports science with regard to player performance and result prediction. However, it is still challenging to quantify team-level game performance because there is no strong ground truth. Thus, a team cannot receive feedback in a standardized way. The aim of this study was twofold. First, we designed a metric called LAX-Score to quantify a collegiate lacrosse team's athletic performance. Next, we explored the relationship between our proposed metric and practice sensing features for performance enhancement. To derive the metric, we utilized feature selection and weighted regression. Then, the proposed metric was statistically validated on over 700 games from the last three seasons of NCAA Division I women's lacrosse. We also explored our biometric sensing dataset obtained from a collegiate team's athletes over the course of a season. We then identified the practice features that are most correlated with high-performance games. Our results indicate that LAX-Score provides insight into athletic performance beyond wins and losses. Moreover, though COVID-19 has stalled implementation, the collegiate team studied applied our feature outcomes to their practices, and the initial results look promising with regard to better performance.\n",
    "Sustainability Calculus in Adopting Smart Speakers--Personalized Services and Privacy Risks": "Despite the benefits of using smart speakers, serious privacy concerns have been raised, particularly due to their constantly listening microphones. Given the mixture of the advantages and risks deciding whether to use them is not an easy matter, casting a doubt about sustainable growth and development of smart speakers. Using a sample of 559 users in South Korea and the U.S., we empirically investigated the dilemma of users seeking to adopt smart speakers. The results revealed users' perceived usefulness and enjoyment positively influenced the intention to adopt smart speakers. No direct effect of perceived ease of use was found but this effect was completely mediated by perceived usefulness and enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment was found to be twice as strong as perceived usefulness in determining the usage intention, confirming the hedonic aspect of smart speakers. Conversely, perceived privacy risks were shown to be a significant negative factor. This negative impact was significantly stronger in the U.S. than in South Korea. We could infer that the more mature the stage of acceptance of smart speakers, the greater the sensitivity of users to privacy risks. Lastly, in the South Korean sample, we found that the perceived usefulness could reduce the negative impact of perceived risks on the intention. to adopt smart speakers.\n",
    "A GIS-based approach for delineating suitable areas for cage fish culture in a lake": "We present a GIS-based approach to the delineation of areas that have different levels of suitability for use as tilapia cage culture sites the Kenyan part of Lake Victoria, Africa. The study area was 4,100 km2. The method uses high-resolution bathymetric data, newly collected water quality data from all major fishing grounds and cage culture sites, and existing spatial information from previous studies. The parameters considered are water depth, water temperature, levels of dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll-aconcentrations, distances to the lake shoreline and proximity to other constraints on cage culture development. The results indicated that the area most suitable for fish cages comprised about 362 km2, or approximately 9% of the total area; the remaining 91% (i.e., 3,737 km2) was found to be unsuitable for tilapia cage culture. We conclude that the successful implementation of this approach would need stakeholder involvement in the validation and approval of potential sites, and in the incorporation of lake zoning into spatial planning policy and the regulations that support sustainable use while minimising resource use conflicts. The results of this study have broader applicability to the whole of Lake Victoria, other African Great Lakes, and any lakes in the world where tilapia cage culture already occurs or may occur in the future.\n",
    "Phytoplankton carbon and nitrogen biomass estimates are robust to volume measurement method and growth environment": "Phytoplankton biomass is routinely estimated using relationships between cell volume and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content that have been defined using diverse plankton that span orders of magnitude in size. Notably, volume has traditionally been estimated with geometric approximations of cell shape using cell dimensions from planar two-dimensional (2D) images, which requires assumptions about the third, depth dimension. Given advances in image processing, we examined how cell volumes determined from three-dimensional (3D), confocal images affected established relationships between phytoplankton cell volume and C and N content. Additionally, we determined that growth conditions could result in 30-40% variation in cellular N and C. 3D phytoplankton cell volume measurements were on average 15% greater than the geometric approximations from 2D images. Volume method variation was minimal compared to both intraspecific variation in volumes (~30%) and the 50-fold variation in elemental density among species. Consequently, C:vol and N:vol relationships were unaltered by volume measurement method and growth environment. Recent advances in instrumentation, including those for at sea and autonomous applications can be used to estimate plankton biomass directly. Going forward, we recommend instrumentation that permits species identification alongside size and shape characteristics for plankton biomass estimates.\n",
    "Identification of Genes Required for Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells In Vitro": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer can be treated with the antiandrogen enzalutamide, but responses and duration of response are variable. To identify genes that support enzalutamide resistance, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in the bone-homing, castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line, C4-2B. We identified 11 genes (TFAP2C, CAD, SPDEF, EIF6, GABRG2, CDC37, PSMD12, COL5A2, AR, MAP3K11, and ACAT1) whose loss resulted in decreased cell survival in response to enzalutamide. To validate our screen, we performed transient knockdowns in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells and evaluated cell survival in response to enzalutamide. Through these studies, we validated three genes (ACAT1, MAP3K11, and PSMD12) as supporters of enzalutamide resistance in vitro. Although ACAT1 expression is lower in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer samples versus primary prostate cancer samples, knockdown of ACAT1 was sufficient to reduce cell survival in C4-2B and 22Rv1 cells. MAP3K11 expression increases with Gleason grade, and the highest expression is observed in metastatic castration-resistant disease. Knockdown of MAP3K11 reduced cell survival, and pharmacologic inhibition of MAP3K11 with CEP-1347 in combination with enzalutamide resulted in a dramatic increase in cell death. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of AR-Serine650, which is required for maximal AR activation. Finally, although PSMD12 expression did not change during disease progression, knockdown of PSMD12 resulted in decreased AR and AR splice variant expression, likely contributing to the C4-2B and 22Rv1 decrease in cell survival. Our study has therefore identified at least three new supporters of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro.\n",
    "Critical Assessment and Reflection on Experience Form: A Novel Approach to Clinical Assessment": "## Context:\nThere is a clear need for quality improvement in health care. The 2020 Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education Standards for Professional Athletic Training Programs require students to apply concepts of quality improvement to provide athletic training care and deliver excellent patient outcomes. As such, programs may be looking for strategies to view students' clinical experiences through a lens of quality improvement.\n\n## Objective:\nTo introduce the Critical Assessment and Reflection on Experience (CARE) form, which is a novel clinical education tool that assesses student clinical skills using critical reflection and quality improvement concepts.\n\n## Background:\nHistorically, students have demonstrated achievement by comparing their skill performance with a competency checklist. Typically, the skills assessed, and the level of achievement expected progress to allow learning over time. However, current athletic training clinical education literature has shifted to promote experiential learning, critical thinking, and active reflection to develop competence.\n\n## Description:\nStudents complete the CARE form after patient encounters or other clinical experiences. The form requires students to practice documentation and communication skills, but also to critically reflect on performance by applying quality improvement, patient safety, and evidence-based practice concepts.\n\n## Clinical Advantage(s):\nThe form holds advantages for multiple stakeholders, including students, preceptors, and program administrators. The CARE form encourages students to engage in authentic patient interactions rather than relying on contrived learning experiences. By encouraging live patient encounters, this tool results in less burden on preceptors to create additional opportunities for students. Program administrators can use the tool to incorporate quality improvement standards meaningfully into the curriculum. Additionally, the CARE form creates opportunity to document program assessment.\n\n## Conclusion(s):\nProfessional programs should consider implementing the CARE form as a clinical experience assessment tool to develop students' quality improvement and critical thinking skills when providing athletic training services.\n",
    "Troubleshooting a Nonresponder: Guidance for the Strength and Conditioning Coach": "Ideally an athlete would continue to improve performance indefinitely over time, however improvement slows as the athlete approaches their genetic limits. Measuring performance is complex--performance may be temporarily depressed following aggressive training for multiple reasons, physiological and psychosocial. This reality may be vexing to the strength and conditioning coach, who, as a service provider, must answer to sport coaches about an athlete's progress. Recently an evaluation mechanism for strength and conditioning coaches was proposed, in part to help coaches establish their effectiveness within the organization. Without formal guidance and realistic expectations, if an athlete is not bigger, leaner, stronger, etc. as a result of training within a specified timeframe, blame is often placed upon the strength and conditioning coach. The purpose of this article is to explore possible causes of what may be perceived as athlete non-responses to training and to provide guidance for the coach on how to handle those issues within their domain. A process of investigation is recommended, along with resources to assist coaches as they consider a broad range of issues, including enhancing existing testing methods, improving athlete behaviors, and adjusting processes designed to bring about performance improvement.\n",
    "The balance between positive and negative affect in employee well-being": "We examine the effects of the balance between positive and negative affect experienced at work on well-being outcomes. An extensive literature on affect balance suggests that it is not only positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) alone that affect well-being; rather it is the balance between them that matters. We use experience sampling methods and polynomial regression to test the notion that daily PA and NA at work, along with their interactive and nonlinear effects, predict employee well-being after work. In a sample of working adults, we find that affect balance--the dynamic interplay between daily PA and NA--at work was differentially associated with various indices of well-being: PA, NA, and the interaction between them predicted physical and mental health. Affect balance at work also predicted life satisfaction, but only for those low on trait affect balance. Detailed examination of the joint effects of PA, NA, and the balance between them reveals that high PA at work is most important for life satisfaction, whereas both low NA and high PA are important for health. Low NA plays an especially important role in physical health.\n",
    "High-Resolution Monitoring of Tidal Systems Using UAV: A Case Study on Poplar Island, MD (USA)": "Tidal processes regulating sediment accretion rates and vegetated platform erosion in tidal systems strongly affect salt marsh evolution. A balance between erosion and deposition in a restored salt marsh is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to be adopted within a natural context. Marsh morphology is also coupled with tidal mudflats and channel networks and this makes micro-tidal systems crucial for a detailed assessment of restoration interventions. Here, we present a methodological approach for monitoring channel morphodynamics and vegetation variations over a time frame of six years in a low tidal energy salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (Maryland, USA). The project is a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. Aerial surveys with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) have been performed for the high-resolution mapping of a small tidal system. Flight missions were planned to obtain a Ground Sample Distance (GSD) of 2 cm. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View-Stereo (MVS) algorithms have been used to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the site. The mapping of channel morphology and an elevation assessment on the mudflat were performed using orthomosaics, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) and GNSS survey. The results highlight that the workflow adopted in this pilot work is suitable to assess the geomorphological evolution over time in a micro-tidal system. However, issues were encountered for salt marsh due to the presence of dense vegetation. The UAV-based photogrammetry approach with GNSS RTK ground surveys can hence be replicated in similar sites all over the world to evaluate restoration interventions and to develop new strategies for a better management of existing shorelines.\n",
    "A Culture of Organizational Grit From the Perspective of U.S. Military Officers: A Qualitative Inquiry": "With the backdrop of the utility of grit at the individual level, speculation has begun to circulate that grit may exist as an organizational level phenomenon. To explore this potential construct, this study used an exploratory, qualitative research design. This study explored grit at the organizational level by interviewing leaders' perceptions of what may be a culture of organizational grit. Participants included 14 U.S. military officers. Seven themes emerged relative to the research question: \"What do U.S. military officers perceive as a culture of organizational grit?\" Themes included professional pride, team unity, resilience-determination, mission accomplishment, core values, growth mindset, and deliberate practice. This study indicated that a culture of organizational grit is likely a combination of converging organizational elements. Overall, findings indicate that there may be a culture of organizational grit in the military and at the least, more research examining the concept is warranted.\n",
    "Seasonality and Characterization Mapping of Restored Tidal Marsh by NDVI Imageries Coupling UAVs and Multispectral Camera": "Salt marsh evolution is strongly affected by tidal processes and ecology, which regulate sediment accretion and erosional rates. A balance between marsh erosion and deposition in a restored tidal wetland is crucial for analyzing restoration strategies to adopt in a natural context. Here, we present an integrated approach monitoring salt marsh seasonal changes over several months in a microtidal restored salt marsh of the Paul S. Sarbanes Ecosystem Restoration Project at Poplar Island (MD, USA). The project is undertaken at a restoration site where sediment dredged from the shipping channels in the upper Chesapeake Bay is being used to restore a tidal marsh habitat in mid-Chesapeake Bay. We flew an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with an RGB and a multispectral camera to obtain a high-resolution map of the planimetric position of vegetation and to monitor the health of the marsh vegetation in diverse seasons. Due to its extension of 400 m by 400 m, a total of four flight plans were necessary to cover the entire marsh flying at a 40 m altitude obtaining a 2 cm Ground Sample Distance (GSD). This technique provides reliable results at a very low cost, enabling an accurate assessment of the marsh platforms to be conducted over time, due to both the very high spatial resolution and the precise georeferencing of the images for the comparisons. Our results show seasonal variability in the two dominant species colonizing the low marsh, Spartina alterniflora, and high marsh, Sporobolus pumilus. While the lower marshes showed a higher variability along seasons, the up-land vegetation showed persistent green foliage during cold seasons. Detecting salt marsh evolution and seasonality coupled with field measurements can help to improve the accuracy of hydrodynamic and sediment transport models. Understanding the drivers of salt marsh evolution is vital for informing restoration practices and designs, in order to improve coastal resilience, and develop and coastal management strategies.\n",
    "Leveraging the NEON Airborne Observation Platform for socio-environmental systems research": "During the 21st century, human-environment interactions will increasingly expose both systems to risks, but also yield opportunities for improvement as we gain insight into these complex, coupled systems. Human-environment interactions operate over multiple spatial and temporal scales, requiring large data volumes of multi-resolution information for analysis. Climate change, land-use change, urbanization, and wildfires, for example, can affect regions differently depending on ecological and socioeconomic structures. The relative scarcity of data on both humans and natural systems at the relevant extent can be prohibitive when pursuing inquiries into these complex relationships. We explore the value of multitemporal, high-density, and high-resolution LiDAR, imaging spectroscopy, and digital camera data from the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) for Socio-Environmental Systems (SES) research. In addition to providing an overview of NEON AOP datasets and outlining specific applications for addressing SES questions, we highlight current challenges and provide recommendations for the SES research community to improve and expand its use of this platform for SES research. The coordinated, nationwide AOP remote sensing data, collected annually over the next 30 yr, offer exciting opportunities for cross-site analyses and comparison, upscaling metrics derived from LiDAR and hyperspectral datasets across larger spatial extents, and addressing questions across diverse scales. Integrating AOP data with other SES datasets will allow researchers to investigate complex systems and provide urgently needed policy recommendations for socio-environmental challenges. We urge the SES research community to further explore questions and theories in social and economic disciplines that might leverage NEON AOP data.\n",
    "Enhancing RNA aggregation through temperature cycling and intrinsically disordered RNA binding peptides": "RNA-protein aggregates akin to membraneless organelles in modern biology offer a potential model for protocells and precursors to protocells in the chemistry of early Earth. In this project, we explore the aggregation properties of nucleic acids and their nucleotide monomers under a variety of conditions using a fluorescence dye-based assay for aggregation. The building blocks of RNA - guanosine monophosphate and adenosine monophosphate showed intrinsic concentration-dependent aggregation. Cyclic incubation between high and low temperatures, mimicking for example conditions around a hydrothermal vent, increased aggregation. This trend was enhanced when experiments were repeated with total RNA extracted from bacterial and fungal sources. RNA aggregation was further enhanced by the incorporation of peptides featuring an RNA binding sequence combined with an intrinsically disordered region. Our results show that RNA aggregation, a key first step on the pathway to protocells, can be enhanced through temperature cycling and the binding of short disordered peptides.\n",
    "Investigations into Multiple Acyl-CoA Assimilation Pathways in a Single Organism": "By 2050 there could be around 12 billion tons of plastic in landfills and the natural environment, which could be avoided by using a more environmentally friendly alternative: biologically produced plastic, or bioplastic. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a bioplastic whose precursor is an intermediate in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway (EMCP), a pathway for acetyl-CoA assimilation in bacteria. The genes that encode the enzymes for two different acetyl-CoA assimilation pathways, the glyoxylate bypass (GB) and the EMCP, have been observed in two PHB-producing bacteria:Rhodobacter capsulatusandParacoccus denitrificans. It was previously observed thatP. denitrificansasynchronously uses both pathways when grown with acetate. We producedR. capsulatusfusion strains by fusing the gene for a fluorescent protein, mCherry, to the gene of a key enzyme of the EMCP or GB and observed the fluorescence during growth with acetate. Tracking fluorescence allowed us to track the accumulation of each key enzyme, which indirectly indicates the activity of the pathway. We observed that unlikeP. denitrificans, the GB inR. capsulatusis not essential to growth with acetate. Understanding the use/occurrence of the EMCP in bacteria is a step to being able to manipulate the EMCP to produce commercially relevant levels of bioplastic and related products.\n",
    "Effect of an 11-Week Resistance Training Program on Arterial Stiffness in Young Women": "Morgan, B, Mirza, AM, Gimblet, CJ, Ortlip, AT, Ancalmo, J, Kalita, D, Pellinger, TK, Walter, JM, and Werner, TJ. Effect of an 11-week resistance training program on arterial stiffness in young women.J Strength Cond Res37(2): 315-321, 2023--The current investigation was conducted to determine the effect of 2 resistance training models on indices of arterial stiffness in young, healthy women. Twenty-four women, untrained college students, aged 18-22 years were randomized into 1 of 3 groups: control (CON) group (n= 8), high-intensity (HI) resistance exercise group (n= 8), and high-volume (HV) resistance exercise group (n= 8). Subjects randomized to resistance training groups were required to perform strength training exercises 3-5 days a week for 11 weeks. The exercise regimen consisted of 2-3 sets of 3-8 repetitions (80-90% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) for the HI group and 3-4 sets of 10-15 repetitions (50-70% of 1RM) for the HV group. All subjects were instructed to continue their normal diet and avoid cardiovascular exercise during the study. After the intervention, there was a significant increase in carotid femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) (6.39 +- 0.73 to 8.40 +- 2.31 m*s-1;p< 0.05) and carotid radial PWV (9.77 +- 1.74 to 12.58 +- 2.09 m*s-1;p< 0.05) in the CON group alone. Both the HI and HV groups increased their maximum squat (36.6 +- 7.9 vs. 41.3 +- 31.8 percent change;p< 0.05), bench press (34.4 +- 12.6 vs. 23.4 +- 11.1 percent change;p< 0.05), and seated row (22.0 +- 12.6 vs. 21.9 +- 12.5 percent change;p< 0.05), respectively. Our findings support the use of resistance training exercise without undue impact on vascular compliance in otherwise healthy women.\n",
    "Reported Self-Efficacy of Health Educators During COVID-19": "The COVID-19 pandemic forced many public health professionals to take on new roles such as online teaching, communicating, and managing; serving on the frontlines of patient care; and serving as health education resource personnel. Researchers of this study posed the question: How has the pandemic impacted those who serve to help others? Seven aspects of self-efficacy in professional practice were examined via an online survey sent to health educators. Respondents were extremely confident communicating with their colleagues and supervisors (60%) and with students (51%), but only 19% were extremely confident in maintaining a work-life balance and 22% in managing personal and professional stress. Respondents reported being confident in all areas of responsibilities, overall, but they were most confident in Area 8 (ethics and professionalism) and least confident in Area 1 (assessing the needs and capacity of a community) since COVID-19. Findings imply a need for more professional development opportunities to foster professional and personal self-efficacy and to improve self-efficacy in needs assessment, leadership, and advocacy. Findings also show a need for workplace or state-based interventions to support resiliency and self-care among professionals who work to serve others.\n",
    "The \"modest majority and big minority\" of climate change: Believers and nonbelievers are inaccurate about the extent that others agree": "Established social psychology literature shows that people demonstrate a systematic bias when estimating the proportion of others who hold their viewpoint on a range of issues; the majority regularly underestimates agreement, and the minority shows even greater error in overestimating agreement with their viewpoint. Applying this to climate change may help us better understand the determinants of public opinion on that issue. Across four studies, we found that people who believe climate change is happening (the majority) underestimate the percentage of other people who hold their view, whereas those who do not believe climate change is happening (the minority) greatly overestimate agreement with their view. We consistently found this pattern for other contemporary issues where there was a clear majority/minority distinction. Furthermore, greater certainty of one's position on climate change was related to greater and more accurate estimates of agreement among the majority, whereas low certainty was associated with estimates closer to 50%. Consistent with cognitive availability as a mechanism for these findings, exploratory analyses suggest that greater certainty of climate change happening is associated with a greater subjective knowledge and frequency of thinking and hearing about climate change, and talking about it with others. Finding the majority/minority pattern of consensus bias for climate change and other issues suggests that general approaches, such as providing accurate normative data and targeting efforts according to a population's belief certainty, may impact public sentiment and engagement on climate change.\n",
    "Conducting Virtual Youth-Led Participatory Action Research (YPAR) During the COVID-19 Pandemic": "Youth-led participatory action research (YPAR) is an applied research methodology in which youth work in collaboration with adult stakeholders to conduct research projects. YPAR has been traditionally conducted in person, with virtual forums typically serving as ways to share resources and ideas across independent YPAR teams or collecting data. The COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the closure of most public spaces where youth congregate (including schools) and requirements to socially distance, led to translating YPAR projects into completely virtual formats. This paper aims to provide promises and challenges of conducting virtual YPAR during the COVID-19 pandemic. It describes how a team of university faculty, college students, and youth from two community-based youth organizations navigated a YPAR experience during the 2020-2021 academic year. We provide reflections on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on (a) the research setting, (b) the building of collaborative relationships, (c) YPAR methodology, (d) youth engagement, and (e) conceptualization of community action and engagement. We end with the implications for the future of YPAR for practitioners.\n",
    "The greatest threats to species": "The growing human population is responsible for a massive decline in species, biodiversity, and ecosystems across the globe. If we are to significantly slow these losses, the attention and resources devoted to individual causes should be commensurate with the magnitude of their contribution to the problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative magnitude of five major threats to species identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as threatened with extinction. Specifically, we analyzed the entire IUCN Red List database to determine the percentage of threatened species affected by overexploitation, climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, and invasive species, diseases, and genes. We also randomly sampled a portion of the database to estimate the percentage of species for which each threat was the dominant threat placing them at risk of extinction. Of the 20,784 species for which data were available, 88.3% were impacted by habitat destruction, 26.6% by overexploitation, 25% by invasives, 18.2% by pollution, and 16.8% by climate change and weather. Focusing on dominant threats, the percentage of species for which a given threat was the main factor pushing them toward extinction was as follows: habitat destruction 71.3%, overexploitation 7.4%, invasives 6.8%, pollution 4.7%, climate change, and weather 1.8%. Regardless of how percentages are calculated, habitat destruction threatens more species than all other categories combined, climate change the fewest. From the perspective of species and biodiversity conservation, these data suggest that a significant change in global environmental priorities is needed. Habitat destruction should become a greater focus of global environmental efforts and receive the attention and resources appropriate to the extraordinary magnitude of its impact. Moreover, while it is important to address all environmental problems, given the disproportionate impact habitat destruction has on species, care should be taken to avoid solutions to other problems that exacerbate this destruction.\n",
    "Investing in Black LGBTQ+ liberation as white people: A call to action for community psychology": "Due to systemic racialized homophobia and transphobia, Black lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) people continue to experience worse life outcomes in comparison to both their Black cisgender and heterosexual, and White LGBTQ+ counterparts. Community psychologists have the tools and training to address these disparities. Using a critical whiteness studies lens, we draw on qualitative data with 17 White LGBTQ+ people to describe how white supremacy manifests in LGBTQ+ spaces. Our research indicates White LGBTQ+ people want to create intersectional spaces but lack the necessary skills to effectively confront anti-Black racism. This resulted in actions which upheld and reinforced white supremacy, despite stated commitments to Black LGBTQ+ liberation. We conclude with recommendations for community psychologists, including engaging in intersectional coalition-building, training centered around queer critical race theory, working to address racialized homophobia and transphobia alongside existing efforts to deconstruct anti-Black racism within community psychology, and consciousness-raising work with White people involved in LGBTQ+ equality movements to dismantle white supremacist structures within their organizations.\n",
    "An Analysis of State Capital Share and Its Implications to the Efficiency-Equality Nexus": "This paper investigates the impact of state ownership on the efficiency-equality tradeoff in a mixed economy with both state and nonstate sectors. Using overall capital productivity as an efficiency proxy and state output share as an inequality proxy, we identify the efficiency threshold of state capital share that splits the efficiency-equality relationship between a tradeoff and nontradeoff. When state capital share is greater than the threshold (as evidenced in the case of China), lowering state capital share improves efficiency and reduces inequality. Furthermore, our simulation results suggest that the threshold is sensitive to capital shares in output of the both sectors. A broad scope for mutual gains in efficiency and equality exists by raising the capital share in nonstate output and lowering the capital share in state output.\n",
    "The Effects of Lavendustin-A on Peripheral Nerve Degeneration in Hyperglycemic Danio rerio": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) results in degenerating peripheral nerves and affects over 50% of people with diabetes. Despite its high prevalence, DPN's molecular pathways remain unknown, limiting treatment to pain management. The Clark lab has characterized two novel models of hyperglycemia in zebrafish in which DPN-like phenotypes are recapitulated, including demyelination. In an attempt to elucidate the unknown molecular mechanisms of DPN, candidate small molecule drugs are currently being tested to accentuate or attenuate neurodegeneration. Lavendustin-A, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was hypothesized to have a neuroprotective role, as overactivation of EGFR in hyperglycemic environments is associated with fibrosis and the inhibition of regeneration in various tissue types.Tg(mbp:gfpcaax)larval zebrafish were incubated in egg water (control 1) or 120mM glucose solution (control 2 and treatment) starting five days post-fertilization (dpf) until 10dpf. From 10-12dpf, control 1 remained in egg water + 1% DMSO, control 2 remained in glucose solution + 1% DMSO, and the treatment group remained in glucose solution + 1% DMSO + 65.5uM Lavendustin-A. 12dpf, lateral images of myelinated (MBP+) peripheral motor nerves were taken on an EVOS imaging system. Fiji (NIH) software was used to measure the length and fluorescent intensity of the myelinated nerves. Both nerve length (*p=0.025) and MBP fluorescent intensity (**p=0.0013) were significantly greater in the treatment group compared to the hyperglycemic fish (control 2), and no significant difference was observed between the treatment group and control 1. To determine if function was impacted, a touch-response assay was conducted before (10dpf) and after (12dpf) drug treatment. Escape response was significantly impaired in hyperglycemic fish (treatment and control 2) at 10dpf (***p=0.0007) and significantly improved in the treatment group by 12dpf (***p=0.0003), yet did not fully recover, as there was still a significant difference between the treatment group and control 1 (**p=0.0017). Our data suggests a possible role of EGFR in hyperglycemia-induced neurodegeneration, getting us one step closer to identifying potential therapeutics for clinical application.\n",
    "Innovations in Teacher Professional Development": "The professional development needs of teachers have changed dramatically over the last 25 years. When constructed to reflect best practices evidenced in the research literature, micro-credentials and other 21st century innovations provide accessible, meaningful, professional learning experiences for educators. This chapter discusses two cases that affected personal transformation and pedagogical change for in-service teachers by an institution of higher education (IHE). A preliminary analysis of these alternative experiences established that when teacher professional development is founded on the context-sensitive integration of social and cultural competencies, meaningful, empowering, and enduring learning can take place.\n",
    "Anarchists and national identity: The case of German radicals in the United States and Brazil, 1880-1945": "How German were German anarchists in the United States and Brazil? Did the experience of exile and immigration preserve or even heighten a national identity among radicals who openly espoused revolutionary internationalism? Anarchists distinguished between nation and nationality on the one hand, and the state and nationalism on the other. This article examines expressions of nationality by a handful of German anarchist editors and writers from the 1880s to the end of World War II. They wanted to be stateless, but not nationless. This article argues that German exile anarchists in the United States and Brazil expressed a militant, countercultural, antistatist and anticlerical nationality. They were 'rooted cosmopolitans': They identified with the international revolutionary tradition and at the same time remained attached to Germany's heritage of radical politics, arts and humanities. There was a remarkable consistency in their commentary levelled against Bismarck, the Kaiser, the Weimar government and the Nazis either in Germany or in the host country. Anarchists advocated for a borderless global federation of free communities and, to that end, rejected nationalism and urged people to stop 'seeing like a state' by exposing the false promises and crimes of statism.\n",
    "Impaired vertebral development following hyperglycemic induction and recovery in Danio rerio": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic condition that can result in numerous comorbidities, including diabetes-induced osteoporosis. Regardless of age, diabetics are at an increased risk of bone fracture as a result of decreased bone quality and mass. In the Clark lab we have previously established a glucose immersion model of hyperglycemic induction in larval zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish are a viable model to study diabetic complications as they glucoregulate similar to mammals and have robust regenerative abilities previously shown to regenerate pancreatic b-cells, peripheral nerves, cardiac muscle, and fins. Given the negative impact diabetes has on bones, we hypothesized that hyperglycemia would negatively impact vertebral development; but given zebrafish's ability to regenerate we also hypothesized that after a recovery from hyperglycemia, the vertebrae would have a similar phenotype to controls. Larval zebrafish were incubated in 120 mM glucose solution (treatment), or egg water (control), for seven days beginning five days post fertilization (dpf). To assess vertebral development following a recovery period, zebrafish were placed in normal egg water for an additional ten days, and control fish were kept in egg water for an equal amount of time. Using alizarin red to visualize mineralized vertebrae after 7-day incubation in glucose solution (12dpf) showed a reduced percentage of zebrafish with any mineralized vertebrae compared to controls (****p<0.0001). The vertebrae that were present following treatment had significantly less area of mineralized centra compared to controls (****p<0.0001). This suggests that hyperglycemia negatively impacted initial vertebral development. Following recovery (22 dpf), the treatment fish had significantly reduced total body length than controls (****p<0.0001). Treatment fish continued to have significantly less mineralized centra area (****p<0.0001) and significantly increased area of intervertebral domain (****p<0.0001) when compared to size matched controls. This suggests that the vertebrae of treatment fish are mineralizing and expanding into the intervertebral domain at a slower rate than controls. Additionally, glucose-treated fish had significantly reduced percentage of fish with mineralized neural (****p<0.0001) and hemal (****p<0.0001) arches present on their vertebra compared to controls. These results suggest a dramatic impairment of vertebral development that extends beyond both treatment and recovery periods, leading us to believe the reduced mineralization may be responsible for the behavioral deficits through reductions in their ability to swim. Furthermore, our results may indicate profound effects of gestation and childhood diabetes on the skeletal development of children. Future experiments will investigate osteoblast and chondrocyte populations following hyperglycemic induction and recovery to elucidate the mechanisms that result in impaired vertebral mineralization. This discovery would guide further research into potential therapeutics for diabetes-induced osteoporosis.\n",
    "Can you hear/see me? Multisensory integration of signals does not always facilitate mate choice": "Females of many species choose mates using multiple sensory modalities. Multimodal noise may arise, however, in dense aggregations of animals communicating via multiple sensory modalities. Some evidence suggests multimodal signals may not always improve receiver decision-making performance. When sensory systems process input from multimodal signal sources, multimodal noise may arise and potentially complicate decision-making due to the demands on cognitive integration tasks. We tested female tungara frog, Physalaemus (=Engystomops) pustulosus, responses to male mating signals in noise from multiple sensory modalities (acoustic and visual). Noise treatments were partitioned into three categories: acoustic, visual, and multimodal. We used natural calls from conspecifics and heterospecifics for acoustic noise. Robotic frogs were employed as either visual signal components (synchronous vocal sac inflation with call) or visual noise (asynchronous vocal sac inflation with call). Females expressed a preference for the typically more attractive call in the presence of unimodal noise. However, during multimodal signal and noise treatments (robofrogs employed with background noise), females failed to express a preference for the typically attractive call in the presence of conspecific chorus noise. We found that social context and temporal synchrony of multimodal signaling components are important for multimodal communication. Our results demonstrate that multimodal signals have the potential to increase the complexity of the sensory scene and reduce the efficacy of female decision making.\n",
    "#Activism: Investor Reactions to Corporate Sociopolitical Activism": "Corporations, which in the past have been hesitant to contribute to conversations regarding political and social issues, are increasingly speaking out on current issues such as race, sexual orientation, gender, immigration, and environmental issues. Despite this trend, limited academic research has focused on how corporate sociopolitical activism (CSA) efforts impact firm value. In addition, extant studies have not fully identified the extent to which the firm and their message influence the outcomes of this approach. The current study explores how sociopolitical stances communicated on Twitter affect firms' stock prices. Results from an event study of 260 incidents of CSA show that CSA efforts decrease firm value by an average of 0.22%, indicating that wading into social or political issues is a risky strategy. However, further analysis highlights the importance of clearly articulating stances on social issues that align with the firm's core values.\n",
    "Terrestrial Capabilities of Invasive Fishes and Their Management Implications": "Amphibious fishes have many adaptations that make them successful in a wide variety of conditions, including air-breathing, terrestrial locomotor capabilities, and extreme tolerance of poor water quality. However, the traits that make them highly adaptable may allow these fishes to successfully establish themselves outside of their native regions. In particular, the terrestrial capabilities of invasive amphibious fishes allow them to disperse overland, unlike fully aquatic invasive fishes, making their management more complicated. Despite numerous amphibious fish introductions around the world, ecological risk assessments and management plans often fail to adequately account for their terrestrial behaviors. In this review, I discuss the diversity of invasive amphibious fishes and what we currently know about why they emerge onto land, how they move around terrestrial environments, and how they orient while on land. In doing so, I use case studies of the performance and motivations of nonnative amphibious fishes in terrestrial environments to propose management solutions that factor in their complete natural history. Amphibious fish species have established a disproportionate number of nonative populations globally compared to fully aquatic species. Because of their terrestrial capabilities, we may need to manage amphibious fishes more like amphibians than fully aquatic fishes, but to do so, we need to learn more about how these species perform in a wide range of terrestrial environments and conditions.\n",
    "Patterns of alliances and acquisitions: An exploratory study": "This study examined how firms combine alliances and acquisitions in an exploration/exploitation framework. By conducting cluster analysis on a sample of 1270 acquisitions made by 836 firms, we first identified the patterns in alliance and acquisition activities undertaken by these firms. Five distinct patterns were identified: (I) low alliance-low acquisition, (II) low alliance-high acquisition, (III) high alliance-low acquisition, (IV) high alliance-high acquisition, and (V) medium alliance-very high acquisition. Next, we analyzed the different ways in which the two modes were interlinked within these five patterns for exploration/exploitation. Patterns III and IV appeared to involve both exploration/exploitation and mutually reinforce exploration/exploitation. In contrast, in the remaining patterns, the two modes appeared to be more loosely coupled with each other, with a focus on exploitation.\n",
    "Market performance and the loss aversion behind green management": "As societies become more concerned with environmental protection, some firms go beyond their legal obligations and proactively adopt their own green management practices even if those practices cannot produce short-term benefits. As a result, researchers have begun to question the underlying motives of these firms. Leveraging corporate loss aversion, we argue that firms that outperform their peers become more risk-seeking to avoid any future loss of competitive advantage. As a result, they become more likely to engage in stakeholder management in the form of green management practices. Specifically, we explore the Green Power Partnership (GPP) which solicits firms to purchase green power. Using the data for the green power consumed by firms that are participating in the GPP program in the United States, we find that firms with performance above social aspiration are likely to increase their use of green power. We also find that related diversification has a negative influence on such motivation.\n",
    "Word/Play: Death of a Salesman": "In Timebends, Miller discusses the \"liberating\" effect that seeing Streetcar had upon his own writing, and particularly upon that of Salesman. One of the effects of this liberation of language upon Miller's play is the incorporation into Salesman of plays on words that contribute substantially to the motifs and themes of the play. In this regard, \"Word/Play\" contributes to the ongoing interest in the careful and imaginative use of language in Salesman, which was neglected for so many years, by exploring comprehensively Miller's use of wordplay, essentially arguing that he employs the device to such an extent that recognizing its presence provides an additional key to the understanding of the play's many rich meanings.\n",
    "Cross-modal facilitation of auditory discrimination in a frog": "Stimulation in one sensory modality can affect perception in a separate modality, resulting in diverse effects including illusions in humans. This can also result in cross-modal facilitation, a process where sensory performance in one modality is improved by stimulation in another modality. For instance, a simple sound can improve performance in a visual task in both humans and cats. However, the range of contexts and underlying mechanisms that evoke such facilitation effects remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated cross-modal stimulation in wild-caught tungara frogs, a species with well-studied acoustic preferences in females. We first identified that a combined visual and seismic cue (vocal sac movement and water ripple) was behaviourally relevant for females choosing between two courtship calls in a phonotaxis assay. We then found that this combined cross-modal stimulus rescued a species-typical acoustic preference in the presence of background noise that otherwise abolished the preference. These results highlight how cross-modal stimulation can prime attention in receivers to improve performance during decision-making. With this, we provide the foundation for future work uncovering the processes and conditions that promote cross-modal facilitation effects.\n",
    "Chronotopic resolution, embodied subjectivity, and collective learning": "In our contribution to this special issue on \"Chronotopes & the COVID-19 Pandemic\", we discuss the\n                    complexities ofhuman survivaland its dependence oncollective learning. We argue that\n                    collective learning - and thus survival - is a sociolinguistic phenomenon and lay out a fractal system in which the related\n                    sociolinguistic processes play out. This system highlights the chronotopic-scalar situatedness of survival and captures the\n                    material, textual, and imagined aspects of learning and meaning-making. Drawing on interactions among a small group of Iranian\n                    migrants dealing with the effects of COVID-19, we discuss the processes through which participants dynamically construct and\n                    update their chronotopic images of their new circumstances, as they interact with material and semiotic data coming from multiple\n                    scales/centers. We show how the normative-semiotic indeterminacies caused by COVID-19 are navigated by social actors as they make\n                    sense of their spatiotemporal surroundings in pursuit of material and ideological survival.\n",
    "The impact of stakeholder orientation on tax avoidance: Evidence from a natural experiment": "We study the effect of stakeholder orientation on corporate tax avoidance. Using the staggered passage of constituency statutes across U.S. states between 1983 and 2006, we show that greater stakeholder orientation results in increased tax avoidance. We further find greater tax avoidance among firms with limited financial resources and that employees benefit from the change. Our results are consistent with stakeholder salience theory that resource-constrained managers prioritize the claims of salient stakeholders, such as employees, at the expense of secondary stakeholders, such as the government.\n",
    "Polemic": "This chapter challenges readings of Johnson as empathetic, arguing instead that polemic forms a crucial and habitual aspect of his characteristic style. The polemical qualities of his conversation are analyzed in examples drawn from the biographical. The bulk of the chapter consists of close analysis of his Parliamentary Debates, which are seen in dialogue with other aspects of print and manuscript culture, and argues that the printed form of these debates may be best described as \"concatenated polemic.\" The conclusion turns to further examples drawn from Johnson's late political writing as well as his literary criticism. In sum, Johnson arrives at some of his most significant insights in the heat of controversy, frequently engaging in dialogue with other texts that is deliberately aggressive and unsparing.\n",
    "Black Lives Matter to media (finally): A content analysis of news coverage during summer 2020": "This study examined 286 stories posted about the Black Lives Matter movement and protests following George Floyd's death by the six most-viewed U.S. news outlets on Facebook during summer 2020. These organizations published a significant amount of content, though the frequency declined throughout the summer. Stories mostly framed protesters positively and police negatively. Organizations regularly used law/crime spot news to frame protests. The findings may signal a potential shift away from the media's protest paradigm.\n",
    "Customer courtesy and service performance: The roles of self-efficacy and social context": "While the impact of negative customer treatment on service employees and their organizations is often emphasized in both scholarship and the popular press, relatively little work has examined the effects of customercourtesy. We draw on the social cognitive theory to theorize that customer courtesy can enhance service performance via its positive effect on employee self-efficacy. Although getting customers to display courtesy may be outside an organization's direct control, we reason that management can amplify these benefits by establishing a strong organizational support climate. To examine our predictions, we developed a customer courtesy scale, then deployed it among service employees in the United States (Study 1) and hotel employees and their supervisors in East Asia (Study 2). We also collected experimental data (Study 3) to test our causal model. Across our studies, our data support the benefits of customer courtesy on employee self-efficacy and, by extension, employee service performance. Moreover, our data reveal that when organizational support climate increases, the effect of customer courtesy on self-efficacy and thus, service performance increases. Although it may be the case that bad is sometimes stronger than good, our work highlights the importance of positive workplace interactions (e.g., customer courtesy) on valued employee outcomes.\n",
    "Faculty Making the Emergency Online Transition During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Effects of Prior Online Teaching Experience and Strategies Used to Learn to Teach Online (Special Edition 2022)": "Objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, university faculty experienced an emergency pivot to online instruction in the Spring 2020 semester. Many had no prior online teaching experience and were given little time to adapt. This study examines pre-pandemic online teaching experience and training strategies used to learn how to teach online during the emergency remote teaching semester, perceptions of change in online teaching ability and the pandemic's impact on teaching effectiveness, and interest in future online teaching opportunities. Method: Full-time faculty (<em>n</em> = 455) from four public regional universities in the southern United States completed a survey at the start of the Fall 2020 semester. Results: Over 35% had no prior online teaching experience, while 43% had taught several online courses. During the pandemic, in an effort to learn or improve online teaching skills, 13.4% sought peer mentoring, 31.9% completed a training program, and 34.9% both sought mentoring and completed training. Perceived online teaching skills, impact of the pandemic on teaching effectiveness, and interest in future online teaching were significantly related to prior online teaching experience and training sought. Conclusions: Faculty with less online experience perceived a greater negative effect of the pandemic on teaching performance and had less interest in future online teaching. Both mentoring and training enhanced perceived teaching skills, lowered the negative impact of the pandemic on teaching effectiveness, and promoted a positive attitude about future online teaching. Implications for Theory or Practice: The results provide support for the importance of faculty development programs in shaping attitudes and perceived effectiveness in online teaching and add to existent research on university faculty during the pandemic. Evidence from studies such as this provides universities with data that may be used to re-evaluate induction and training to improve instructional delivery in future instances when emergency remote teaching is required.\n",
    "Multiple trophic pathways support fish on floodplains of California's Central Valley": "We used compound-specific isotope analysis of carbon isotopes in amino acids (AAs) to determine the biosynthetic source of AAs in fish from major tributaries to California's Sacramento-San Joaquin river delta (i.e., the Sacramento, Cosumnes and Mokelumne rivers). Using samples collected in winter and spring between 2016 and 2019, we confirmed that algae are a critical component of floodplain food webs in California's Central Valley. Results from bulk stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen in producers and consumers were adequate to characterize a general trophic structure and identify potential upstream and downstream migration into our study site by American shadAlosa sapidissimaand rainbow troutOncorhynchus mykiss, respectively. However, owing to overlap and variability in source isotope compositions, our bulk data were unsuitable for conventional bulk isotope mixing models. Our results from compound-specific carbon isotope analysis of AAs clearly indicate that algae are important sources of organic matter to fish of conservation concern, such as Chinook salmonOncorhynchus tshawytschain California's Central Valley. However, algae were not the exclusive source of energy to metazoan food webs. We also revealed that other sources of AAs, such as bacteria, fungi and higher plants, contributed to fish as well. While consistent with the well-supported notion that algae are critical to aquatic food webs, our results highlight the possibility that detrital subsidies might intermittently support metazoan food webs.\n",
    "Toxicity, horizontal transfer, and physiological and behavioral effects of cycloxaprid against Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)": "## BACKGROUND:\nThe red imported fire ant,Solenopsis invictaBuren, is a significant urban, agricultural, and medical pest with a wide distribution in the world. Surface or mound treatment using contact insecticide is one of the main methods to controlS. invicta. In the present study, cycloxaprid, a newly discovered neonicotinoid insecticide, was evaluated forS. invictacontrol and compared with two referent insecticides, imidacloprid and bifenthrin.\n\n## RESULTS:\nSurfaces or sand treated with cycloxaprid, imidacloprid, or bifenthrin caused high mortality ofS. invictaworkers, and the action of cycloxaprid or imidacloprid was slower than bifenthrin. Like imidacloprid and bifenthrin, cycloxaprid can be horizontally transferred from corpses or live donor ants to recipient ants. In addition, cycloxaprid- or imidacloprid-treated surfaces significantly induced the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and detoxification enzymes; nevertheless, they had no significant effect on the foraging behaviors ofS. invictaworkers. Also, sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid did not negatively affect the digging activities of ants. Interestingly,S. invictaworkers excavated significantly more sand containing 0.01 mg/kg cycloxaprid than untreated sand in the no-choice digging bioassays. In addition, extensive nesting activities (sand excavation and stacking) were observed in the flowerpots containing untreated sand or sand treated with cycloxaprid or imidacloprid. On the contrary, bifenthrin significantly reduced the foraging, digging, and nesting activities ofS. invictaworkers.\n\n## CONCLUSION:\nCycloxaprid is a slow-acting and nonrepellent insecticide againstS. invictaworkers, and its contact and horizontal toxicities are slightly higher than imidacloprid.

    "Microbial community succession along a chronosequence in constructed salt marsh soils": "In this study, we examined the succession of soil microbial communities across a chronosequence of newly constructed salt marshes constructed primarily of fine-grained dredge material, using 16S rRNA amplicon sequences. Alpha diversity in the parent material was initially low and increased to reference levels within 3 years of marsh construction, while in the newly accumulating organic matter-rich surface soils alpha diversity was initially high and remained unchanged. Microbial community succession was fastest in the surface horizon (~ 24 years to reference equivalency) and became progressively slower with depth in the subsurface horizons (~ 30-67 years). Random forest linear regression analysis was used to identify important taxa driving the trajectories toward reference conditions. In the parent material, putative sulfate-reducers (Desulfobacterota), methanogens (Crenarchaeota, especiallyMethanosaeta), and fermenters (ChloroflexiandClostridia) increased over time, suggesting an enrichment of these metabolisms over time, similar to natural marshes. Concurrently in the surface soils, the relative abundances of putative methane-, methyl-, and sulfide oxidizers, especially amongGammaproteobacteria, increased over time, suggesting the co-development of sulfide and methane removal metabolisms in the marsh soils. Finally, we observed that the surface soil communities at one of the marshes did not follow the trajectory of the others, exhibiting a greater relative abundance of anaerobic taxa. Uniquely in this dataset, this marsh was developing signs of excessive inundation stress in terms of vegetation coverage and soil geochemistry. Therefore, we suggest that soil microbial community structures may be effective bioindicators of salt marsh inundation and are worthy of further targeted investigation.\n",
    "Foraging by estuarine juveniles of two paralichthyid flounders: experimental analyses of the effects of light level, turbidity, and prey type": "Juvenile summer flounderParalichthys dentatusand southern flounderP. lethostigmainhabit turbid salt marsh estuaries. Predation rates by juveniles (50-90 mm) were examined at 5 daytime light levels (6 x 1011to 2 x 1014quanta s-1cm-2) and in darkness and 4 turbidity levels (clear [<=1], 11, 20, and 40 NTU) at an intermediate light level. Both species fed equally well on benthopelagic mysid shrimp and benthic spionid polychaetes at all daytime light levels tested. However, predation on mysids was significantly reduced in the dark. Consumption of polychaetes was not reduced in the dark by either species, illustrating the effectiveness of non-visual foraging methods on benthic prey. Turbidity levels tested did not affect predation on either prey type by either flounder species. Locomotor behavior was examined at the same turbidity levels.P. lethostigmaspent more time swimming in the water column thanP. dentatusin lower turbidity (clear-20 NTU), and both species reduced swimming at 40 NTU. It appears that both species primarily use a benthic-oriented ambush foraging strategy under high turbidity conditions. This is a particularly pronounced switch in foraging style forP. lethostigma. Estuarine turbidity is increasing due to the impacts of climate change. When turbidity is elevated enough to eliminate light sufficient for visual feeding on mysids (between darkness and the lowest light level tested), feeding on this motile prey is negatively impacted for both species. Turbidity can thus alter foraging modes and types of prey consumed, affecting nursery habitat quality and the prey base supporting these young fishes.\n",
    "Climate to COVID, global to local, policies to people: a biopsychosocial ecological framework for syndemic prevention and response in behavioral medicine": "Land development, pollution, and waste have affected natural environments, contributing to hurricanes, wildfires, and pandemic infectious diseases like COVID-19. Globalized corporate food systems that produce ultra-refined foods with low nutritional value contribute to both environmental conditions and health conditions like obesity and undernutrition. This has the greatest impact on communities already suffering from elevated health risks driven by economic inequities rooted in racism. These interacting environmental, health, and social conditions represent a syndemic. We outline practical suggestions to address this syndemic of environmental degradation, pandemic infectious disease, chronic disease, undernutrition, and inequity through research and practice at many levels, including individual behavior, local communities, and regional, national and global policy. Collaboration with communities is central to simultaneously tackling interconnected human and environmental health threats. For example, community-led groups have increased access to healthy food in response to pandemic conditions. Building on behavioral medicine's rich foundation of ecological models, communities have partnered with local researchers to address the needs of equitable public transport and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through multilevel research and practice. Policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and community members should collaborate with each other and across disciplines to find lasting, multiduty solutions to improve physical, psychosocial, and planetary health.\n",
    "Effects of a Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Agonist on Sex Behavior in Females of the Southern Giant Pouched Rat": "In general, males should be particularly attentive to cues of sexual availability and females should advertize accordingly. Vaginal patency (i.e., the openness of the vagina) is a reliable indicator of sexual maturity; if the vagina is closed, the female is unable to copulate. The southern giant pouched rat (Cricetomys ansorgei) is unusual because females can have fully fused vaginal openings (i.e., vaginal nonpatency) despite being considered \"adults\" by other metrics. Moreover, some females reversibly close their vaginal openings. Thus, vaginal patency in the pouched rat is a \"flexible\" reproductive state. We subcutaneously implanted a long-acting GnRH agonist (deslorelin), which over time inhibits sex steroid secretion, to better understand the endocrinology and social behavior relating to vaginal patency in this species. We hypothesized that altering GnRH would impact both patency and behavior through its effects on circulating levels of estradiol. Six months of deslorelin treatment did not alter vaginal patency. Behaviorally, deslorelin-treated females spent less time interacting with, and were more aggressive towards males (compared to controls). Notably, deslorelin did not alter female scent marking. We conclude that behavioral receptivity, but not vaginal patency, is impacted by GnRH hormonal cascades in the pouched rat.\n",
    "Interactive Documentary Filmmaking and Student Engagement With Community": "This paper describes a curricular project in which a network of media educators, in making a case for the educational and social values of an interactive documentary, integrated it in a media degree program to encourage activism in students and promote civic engagement. The project provides valid and important results in an immediate sense, while also establishing the foundation for strengthening the media curriculum at educational institutions. For educators, this has positive implications, as along with the traditional content we teach, we also strive to increase the awareness of civic issues among our students to make them better citizens.\n",
    "Endocrine therapy initiation and overall survival outcomes with omission of radiation therapy in older Medicare patients with early-stage hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer": "## Background:\nGuidelines allow for the omission of radiotherapy in older women with early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, given that the patients receive adequate endocrine therapy (ET). However, the initiation of ET and survival outcomes after forgoing radiation therapy among these patients have not been well-studied.\n\n## Methods:\nWe identified patients aged 70 to 90 years old newly diagnosed in 2010-2015 with early-stage, hormone receptor positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (HR+/Her2-) breast cancer who received lumpectomy and omitted radiation therapy using the SEER-Medicare database. We examined the initiation of ET and the utilization patterns of ET using a multivariable logistic regression. We further examined the overall survival outcomes using Kaplan-Meier estimation and Cox proportional hazard model with inverse probability weighting.\n\n## Results:\nOf the 2618 patients, 808 (30.9%) received no ET. The multivariable logistic regression showed that more recent years had better ET initiation (2013-2015 vs. 2010-2012: OR = 1.39, 95% CI:[1.16, 1.66]), while older patients (81-90 vs. 70-80: OR = 0.45, 95% CI:[0.38, 0.54]) were less likely to receive ET. Both the Kaplan-Meier estimation (log-rank p-value<0.0001) and the Cox proportional hazard model with inverse probability weighting (HR = 0.76, 95% CI:[0.58, 0.99]) showed that receiving ET was associated with better overall survival.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThis population-based study suggests that a sizable proportion of patients who omitted radiation did not receive endocrine therapy and receiving endocrine therapy was beneficial among these patients. Although ET initiation has improved in more recent years, certain patient groups were still especially susceptible to no endocrine therapy.\n",
    "The Effects of Vision-Deprived Progressive Resistance Training on One-Repetition Maximum Bench Press Performance: An Exploratory Study": "The objective of this study was to determine whether vision-occluded progressive resistance training would increase upper-extremity movement performance using the one-repetition maximum (1-RM) bench press. Participants (n = 57) were recruited from a historically black college and university (HBCU), cross-matched by sex, age (+-1 year), 1-RM (+-2.27 kg), 1-RM/weight (+-0.1), and 1-RM/lean mass ratio (+-0.1), and randomly assigned to either the experimental group (vision occluded) or the control group. Participants performed resistance training for 6 weeks prior to beginning the study, and 1-RM was assessed the week prior to the beginning of the study. Weight and body composition were measured using a BOD POD. Of the 57 participants who started the study, 34 completed the study (Experimental = 16, Control = 18) and were reassessed the week after completing the 6-week-long training protocol. Using a combination of Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, we found that when accounting for changes in lean muscle mass, individuals who trained with their vision occluded reported significantly greater improvements in 1-RM strength compared to those who did not (p < 0.05). The findings from our study suggest that vision-occluded progressive resistance training increases upper-extremity performance when assessed using the bench press. These findings may have significant practical implications in both sports and rehabilitation, as these techniques may be used to enhance performance in athletes and/or improve rehabilitation effectiveness.\n",
    "Stellar multiplicity and stellar rotation: insights from APOGEE": "We measure rotational broadening in spectra taken by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey to characterize the relationship between stellar multiplicity and rotation. We create a sample of 2786 giants and 24 496 dwarfs with stellar parameters and multiple radial velocities from the APOGEE pipeline, projected rotation speeds vsin i determined from our own pipeline, and distances, masses, and ages measured by Sanders & Das. We use the statistical distribution of the maximum shift in the radial velocities, DRVmax, as a proxy for the close binary fraction to explore the interplay between stellar evolution, rotation, and multiplicity. Assuming that the minimum orbital period allowed is the critical period for Roche Lobe overflow and rotational synchronization, we calculate theoretical upper limits on expected vsin i and DRVmax values. These expectations agree with the positive correlation between the maximum DRVmax and vsin i values observed in our sample as a function of log(g). We find that the fast rotators in our sample have a high occurrence of short-period [log(P/d)  4] companions. We also find that old, rapidly rotating main-sequence stars have larger completeness-corrected close binary fractions than their younger peers. Furthermore, rapidly rotating stars with large DRVmax consistently show differences of 1-10 Gyr between the predicted gyrochronological and measured isochronal ages. These results point towards a link between rapid rotation and close binarity through tidal interactions. We conclude that stellar rotation is strongly correlated with stellar multiplicity in the field, and caution should be taken in the application of gyrochronology relations to cool stars.\n",
    "Regenerative potential and limitations in a zebrafish model of hyperglycemia-induced nerve degeneration": "## Background:\nPrevious work from our lab has described a model of motor nerve degeneration in hyperglycemic zebrafish larvae which resembles mammalian models of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). Here, we optimized the hyperglycemic-induction protocol, characterized deficits in nerve structure and behavioral function, and then examined the regenerative potential following recovery from the hyperglycemic state.\n\n## Results:\nIn agreement with our previous work, hyperglycemia induced motor nerve degeneration and behavioral deficits. However, the optimized protocol initiated disruption of tight junctions within the blood-nerve barrier, a phenotype apparent in mammalian models of DPN. Following a 10-day recovery period, regeneration of motor nerve components was apparent, but behavioral deficits persisted. We next examined the effect of hyperglycemia on the musculoskeletal system and found subtle deficits in muscle that resolved following recovery, and robust deficits in the skeletal system which persisted following recovery.\n\n## Conclusion:\nHere we optimized our previous model of hyperglycemia-induced motor nerve degeneration to more closely align with that observed in mammalian models and then characterized the regenerative potential following recovery from hyperglycemia. Notably, we observed striking impairments to skeletal development, which underscores the global impact hyperglycemia has across systems, and provides a framework for elucidating molecular mechanisms responsible for regenerative events moving forward.\n",
    "Soil drainage-class influences on the distribution of witness trees (1664-1700) in Wicomico County, Maryland, USA": "Given the long-term human habitation and prolific land use change trajectories in the eastern United States, few remnants of the pre-European settlement Mid-Atlantic forest remain on the Atlantic Coastal Plain. This study utilized metes and bounds witness tree locations and descriptions produced during colonial land subdivision to understand the relationships between tree types and biogeographic environments for an area on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Using correspondence analysis, we reveal habitat partitioning among witness tree species based on soil drainage characteristics, that enable the visualization of a pre-European settlement reconstructed forest. Our research finds that oak ( Quercus), most often white oak ( Quercus alba), was the dominant genus for most of the study area underlain by well-drained soils. To a much smaller extent, gums were also associated with these well-drained soils. Areas of poor drainage most often contained pine ( Pinus) and an assemblage of different oaks ( Quercus spp.). Hickory ( Carya), also noted in the witness tree record in small numbers, was found across all soil drainages.\n",
    "Theory-based Evaluation of Lesson Study Professional Development: Challenges, Opportunities, and Lessons Learned": "\"Lesson study\" has garnered considerable attention from educational researchers and practitioners as a promising method for improving instruction. At its core, lesson study reflects a collaborative inquiry process, grounded in cycles of planning, enacting, and reflecting, that promotes teacher learning through active engagement in lesson refinement. In this article, we leverage lesson study as an exemplar case to foreground an examination and application of theory-based evaluation. We overview a novel evaluation framework contextualized to this multidimensional instructional program and draw out the contributions of theory-based evaluation to the study of program effects. To ground the description of this framework, we summarize representative findings from our ongoing evaluation of a lesson study-based instructional program and discuss processes for selecting, using, and managing evidence sources as well as determining causal strands supporting program outcomes. We conclude by discussing lessons learned and implications for theory-based evaluation of complex programs.\n",

    "District-wide school reform and student performance: Evidence from Montgomery County, Maryland": "In the early 2000s, the Montgomery County (Maryland) Public School system implemented district-wide changes to funding, curriculum, staffing, and technology. Using data from 1995 to 2014, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy to show that the reforms significantly increased the percentage of students in Montgomery County who scored advanced on third- and fifth-grade math and reading tests. Using an event study strategy, we find that the positive impacts extended through the end of the panel. Our results contribute to the literature on school reform by finding positive impacts of school reform in a district that was high performing prior to reforms.\n",
    "The Effectiveness of Intersectional Political Science Pedagogy in an Introductory Course in American Public Policy": "The study seeks to confront the challenge of incorporating the role of inequality, identity, and intersectionality into political science teaching and learning. In this quasi-experimental design, we explore the variation in two introductory courses in public policy. The design and content were similar for both sections. For the experimental section, we integrated intersectional political science pedagogy. This section employed a flipped classroom, introducing innovative approaches to grading and assessment that were accessible, inclusive, and anti-racist. In the control group section, the course was traditionally taught without supplemental material on intersectionality or the more innovative and unconventional pedagogy. We hypothesize that students enrolled in the intersectional section will have more interest and knowledge in public policy, as well as a deeper understanding of racial progress as it relates to the policy process. Moreover, we predict that students will display some resistance and discomfort when it comes to participating in class discussions.\n",
    "(Not) far from home: No sex bias in dispersal, but limited genetic patch size, in an endangered species, the Spotted Turtle (Clemmys guttata)": "Sex-biased dispersal is common in many animals, with male-biased dispersal often found in studies of mammals and reptiles, including interpretations of spatial genetic structure, ostensibly as a result of male-male competition and a lack of male parental care. Few studies of sex-biased dispersal have been conducted in turtles, but a handful of studies, in saltwater turtles and in terrestrial turtles, have detected male-biased dispersal as expected. We tested for sex-biased dispersal in the endangered freshwater turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) by investigating fine-scale genetic spatial structure of males and females. We found significant spatial genetic structure in both sexes, but the patterns mimicked each other. Both males and females typically had higher than expected relatedness at distances <25 km, and in many distance classes greater than 25 km, less than expected relatedness. Similar patterns were apparent whether we used only loci in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (n= 7) or also included loci with potential null alleles (n= 5). We conclude that, contrary to expectations, sex-biased dispersal is not occurring in this species, possibly related to the reverse sexual dimorphism in this species, with females having brighter colors. We did, however, detect significant spatial genetic structure in males and females, separate and combined, showing philopatry within a genetic patch size of <25 km inC. guttata, which is concerning for an endangered species whose populations are often separated by distances greater than the genetic patch size.\n",
    "The effects of fish oil supplementation on arterial stiffness and cognitive function in healthy adults: a pilot study": "Introduction: Elevated aortic and carotid artery stiffness are associated with subclinical brain damage and cognitive impairment. Fish oil (FO) is a popular dietary supplement that lowers blood pressure and aortic stiffness. However, the hypothesis that FO supplementation reduces carotid artery stiffness and improves cognitive function in healthy adults requires further investigation. Our objective was to determine the effects of FO supplementation on arterial stiffness and cognitive function in healthy adults. We hypothesized that 6-weeks of FO supplementation would lower arterial stiffness and improve cognitive function. Methods: 25 healthy adults were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arms intervention to investigate the effects of 6-week FO supplementation (4g/day) on vascular and cognitive function. Aortic stiffness was measured using applanation tonometry and quantified as carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and beta-stiffness index (bstiff), and carotid artery stiffness was determined using ultrasonography. Cognitive function was assessed using NIH toolbox cognitive battery. A two-way analysis of variance was used to test differences in treatment groups over time. Results: The mean (+- SD) baseline age, body mass index, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure was 40.4 +- 20.6 years, 23.7 +- 2.4 kg/m2, 120.9 +- 14.7 mmHg, and 74.9 +- 12.4 mmHg in the fish oil group and 33.3 +- 14.5 years, 25.3 +- 3.9 kg/m2, 120.8 +- 6.4 mmHg, and 71.9 +- 7.8 mmHg in the placebo group, respectively. Compared to the national averages, our participants scored slightly above average (within one standard deviation) on all tests within the NIH cognitive battery. Within-group comparison revealed no differences in central or peripheral blood pressure, aortic or carotid stiffness, and cognitive function after fish oil supplementation (all p>0.05). Conclusion: Our preliminary data suggest that in healthy, cognitively normal adults, 6- weeks of FO supplementation does not impact indices of arterial stiffness or cognitive function. Further investigation with more participants and of longer duration is needed to confirm our findings regarding the effects of fish oil supplementation on carotid artery stiffness and cognitive function.\n\nThis is the full abstract presented at the American Physiology Summit 2023 meeting and is only available in HTML format.

    "Broken engagement: The role of grit and LMX in enhancing faculty engagement": "As the roles of faculty members have continued to expand, leaders in higher education need a better understanding of the drivers of faculty engagement. The current paper develops and tests a hypothesized model of faculty engagement in which faculty member grit is positively related to faculty member engagement both directly and indirectly through faculty member-academic chair leader member exchange (LMX). Using a sample of 156 faculty members in a mid-sized public university in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, we tested the hypothesized model using PROCESS Model 4 with 5000 boot-strapped samples and a 95% confidence interval. Results show significant direct positive relationships between faculty member grit and faculty member engagement and between faculty member-academic chair LMX and faculty member engagement, but no significant indirect relationship of faculty member grit through LMX. Implications for higher education leaders are discussed, along with limitations and directions for future research.\n",
    "The relationship between neighborly social capital and health outcomes": "## Background:\nThere is increasing interest in understanding the relationship between social capital and undesirable health outcomes. Social capital theory suggests that better health outcomes may result from certain \"neighborly\" aspects of social capital.\n\n## Methods:\nThis study used secondary data from the Social Capital Index. Bivariate correlations were calculated between neighborly social capital and health outcome variables. Next, neighborly social capital variables were entered as predictors of health outcomes in a series of stepwise regressions. Regional comparisons were conducted across four U.S. regions. Comparisons of the regression model structures were conducted by applying a model derived from one region to the data from another region and contrasting the resulting crossed R2 with the original direct R2 to identify differential regression weights across the four regions that warrant interpretation.\n\n## Results:\nThe correlation and regression analyses showed significant negative relationships between three neighborly social capital variables (% who do favors for their neighbors, % who worked with neighbors to improve something, and % who trust all or most of their neighbors) and health outcomes including: % in fair/poor health, premature mortality rate, % diabetic, and % obese. In regional comparisons, only the South region had a direct and crossed R2 significantly different from other regions, with this difference largely attributable to an unexpected positive relationship between trusting neighbors and negative health outcomes in the South.\n\n## Conclusions:\nInterventions to increase neighborly social capital may help to alleviate negative health outcomes in the U.S. Anomalously, in the South, trusting neighbors may be related to worse health outcomes.\n\n## Key messages:\n* Being neighborly may enhance positive health outcomes in most parts of the U.S.\n\n* Strong social support impacts urban health.\n",
    "DEVELOPMENT OF TWO GERIATRIC CASES TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR THE NEXT-GENERATION RN LICENSING EXAM": "With the implementation of the Next Generation NCLEX-RN (NGN) national licensing examination in April of 2023, faculty in state of Maryland nursing schools were solicited for participation in a Maryland Nursing Workforce Center grant initiative to develop a repository of NGN case studies. A major change in the exam was the integration of a six-step clinical judgment model using a case-based format with client information presented in an electronic medical record using new question types designated for each of the steps presented sequentially. Twenty faculty \"champions\" from 13 Maryland schools attended several training sessions and were to develop two peer-reviewed cases for inclusion in the Qualtrics database. Once approved, these cases could then be accessed online via a secure link or QR code by Maryland-based nursing faculty and shared with students for instructional and practice purposes. Two gero-focused cases were developed. The first case focused on an older adult in a long-term care facility admitted to the hospital for a urinary tract infection with potential complication of urosepsis. Another featured a hospitalized older adult client with Alzheimer's disease admitted from home with dehydration with potential for delirium superimposed on dementia. While a major objective of this innovative and proactive state-wide initiative is to optimize success on the modified NCLEX-RN, it is also hoped that these case examples, when appropriately integrated into the nursing curriculum, will enhance understanding of common geriatric scenarios and better prepare graduates for safe, effective nursing care of older adults.\n",
    "Exposing the hazards of teaching 19th century genetic science": "Science should provide students an accurate and contemporary education on genetic influence, particularly how it impacts trait variability and developmental norms. Stories involving familial, racial, and sexual differences routinely appear in the popular media and sales of over-the-counter genetic tests are mounting. Unfortunately, research suggests genetic curricula in secondary education and university courses have little impact on genetic literacy; instead they appear to amplify genetic essentialism. This position paper reports on genetic essentialism, the impact of three components of science education (teachers, students, curriculum), and critiques existing genetic lessons in two prevalent scientific disciplines, biology and psychology. Two entrenched 19th century genetic paradigms (e.g., Mendelian inheritance and behavioral genetics) are specifically examined. The paper closes with specific recommendations for improving students' genetic literacy including important contemporary genetic science (e.g., epigenetics) and instructional approaches (e.g., learning progression, refutational teaching).\n",
    "Time Use and Subjective Well-Being of Multiple Jobholders: Evidence From the American Time Use Survey": "Millions of workers hold more than one job. Multiple jobholders work various combinations of part-time and full-time jobs, which suggests they might spend their time differently than single jobholders, and the second job might affect an individual's subjective well-being. Using data from the 2003-2019 American Time Use Survey, I show that multiple jobholders work and commute more, and spend less time relaxing, sleeping, and doing housework than single jobholders. Overall, multiple jobholders are less likely to report being rested and having a good life relative to single jobholders. I also show how these differences vary by gender and race.\n",

The frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions due to human-induced climate change have alarmingly increased. Consequently, climate change directly affects environmental sustainability and human mortality in the short term and creates prolonged and complicated long-term indirect grave risks.

It proposes a conceptual framework for developing an empirical event-based human mortality database related to climate change and communication strategies to enhance global environmental adaptation, resilience, and sustainability.\n",
    "Opening the gates: The increasing impact of papers beyond the top five and other changes in economic publishing": "The field of economics is undergoing a paradigm shift, marked by what has become known as the \"credibility revolution.\" This shift has impacted what economists write about, how they organize and structure their papers, and where they chose to publish their findings. This paper traces publishing trends from the 100 most cited papers in the decades from 1970 to 2019 (500 papers in total). Data suggest that the field has become more empirical and that the structure of papers is more standardized, often following a format that is closer to that of scientific papers. Increases in the percentage of women first-listed authors and the gender ratio are noted and found to be correlated with emerging fields. Most interestingly, a decreasing number of highly cited papers are from what are generally considered the \"Top 5\" journals in economics, suggesting increasing importance of articles published outside of the Top 5.\n",
    "What Factors Entice States to Manipulate Corporate Income Tax Apportionment Formulas?": "Numerous states have altered the sales factor weight in their corporate income tax (CIT) apportionment formulas. We are among the first to examine which political and economic factors are important in determining whether and when states manipulate sales factor weights. We apply survival model techniques to a panel of state-level data for the years 1985-2012. Our most striking result is that a higher CIT rate is associated with faster movement to a higher sales factor weight. Perhaps indicating that, for economic development, states use sales factor manipulation in lieu of reducing CIT rates broadly, or alternatively, that states raise sales factor weights to compensate for higher statutory CIT rates. Results also indicate that stronger growth in the CIT base and in non-corporate tax revenues hasten sales factor weight increases. Democratic control of the state government and gubernatorial election years are also important in the timing of sales factor manipulation.\n",
    "A Cross-Disciplinary Examination of the Instructional Uses of ChatGPT in Higher Education": "This paper examines the potential uses of ChatGPT in generating assessment tasks that can be used across different disciplines in higher education. To illustrate this, we provide examples from three courses in the disciplines of industrial engineering and applied linguistics: Project Analysis and Control, Manufacturing Processes, and Introduction to Linguistics. Our examination of ChatGPT focuses on how some of the common, but time-consuming, tasks can be generated by using ChatGPT as a supportive instructional tool. We observed in our analysis that ChatGPT demonstrates a high level of performance in generating assessment questions and tasks that are accurate and on-topic, and a level of creativity and flexibility in its question generation capabilities. However, it is important to note that ChatGPT is not designed to replace human expertise or judgment. It is crucial that instructors carefully evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the assessments or information generated by ChatGPT.\n",
    "Food retailing in developing economies: Review of empirical insights and new directions": "Food retailing in developing economies has undergone significant transformations over the past three decades. Progressing in three waves across regions like Latin America, Asia, Africa, and beyond, food retailers have transitioned from traditional open markets to modern supermarkets akin to those in more developed economies. In this article, we provide an overview of the structure of food retailing in developing economies and examine the empirical literature that delves into the reasons behind the evolution of retailers in developing countries worldwide, as well as their impact on suppliers and consumers. We propose avenues for future research, building upon an empirical framework that recognizes the consumer-driven nature of retail evolution and how the structure of retailing develops as an equilibrium outcome within a dynamic, imperfectly competitive environment. In conclusion, we identify significant gaps in the existing empirical literature and shed light on emerging questions that are likely to gain importance in the future.

    "Pedagogical Purgatory": "Identity formation in undergraduate teacher preparation programs is often challenging for teacher candidates. Future teachers sometimes find themselves in tension-filled situations where university preparation program practices contradict expectations of elementary school internships or their beliefs about teaching children. Often, teacher candidates are relegated to two choices: conform to the internship context, survive, or resist and risk potential denial to the system towards which they feel dissonance . This chapter shows how two teacher candidates in a two-year full-time teacher residency preparation program felt dissonance towards their internship setting mentor teachers and how they leveraged the structure of their university program to advance their teaching status in those contexts. Through scapegoating the literacy content coach and coaching cycle, Megan and Natalie impacted children's learning experiences and their teacher identities.\n",
    "On the Way to Divine Providence: From the Abyss of Time to the Throe of Eternity": "Divine providence, as traditionally conceived, keeps historical time subordinate to God's sovereignty so that the divine plan for it is fulfilled. This article argues that the starting point for theologizing about providence ought to be the logic of radical generosity in play when the divine Thou creates historical time as a reality unto itself by giving it an unprecedented future. Providence does not protect the historically conditioned universe from this future; it draws the universe into it. The human experience of grace offers us a paradigmatic example of this.\n",
    "Cardiovascular Disease Risk Screening for Commercial Drivers Examined in Occupational Practice: Implementing Evidence-Based Practice to Champion the Health of Essential Workers": "## Background:\nCardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with 20% of deaths in adults under age 65. Commercial drivers have an increased CVD incidence rate of 50% compared to 30% for the general population, yet one third of drivers will not be screened for risk factors due to a lack of insurance or primary care. With approximately 3.5 million commercial drivers nationally and correlation of CVD to increased motor vehicle accidents, fatalities, and excessive healthcare costs, addressing the care gap for this high-risk population is imperative.\n\n## Methods:\nAn evidence-based practice (EBP) project synthesized the literature and implemented CVD risk screening for commercial drivers examined in an occupational practice setting. Using the non-laboratory Framingham CVD risk score calculator, over 90% of drivers were screened during mandated medical examinations and provided education regarding modifiable risk factors during a 2-month period.\n\n## Findings:\nOver 40% of commercial drivers were at high risk for CVD with 25% uninsured and 32% without primary care. The average CVD risk score was twice the general population's risk score, with obesity, hypertension, and smoking being the most common risk factors discussed.\n\n## Conclusions/Application to Practice:\nIncorporating CVD risk screening and education during opportune encounters is logical, efficient, and financially prudent. The EBP change supports occupational professionals' standards, and ongoing review of CVD screening guidelines with integration into practice provides health promotion and promotes public safety for these essential workers.\n",
    "Experiences of Alienation and Intimacy: The Work of Secondary Writing Instruction": "Drawing on critical theories of labor and commodification, this qualitative embedded case study explores how students experience alienation and intimacy in the work of writing for an English language arts class. Analysis of fieldnotes from 30 observations, student writing products, and reflective interviews with focal students and the teacher illuminated the meaningful assemblages where conditions of intimacy permeated instruction. Two practices supported intimacy in working conditions: knowledge about writing built through a collective process of noticing, and open-ended work time characterized by \"managed nonmanagement\" (, p. 176), or calculated flexibility in rules and expectations. Findings illustrate how a literacy practice might contribute to students' experience of alienation or intimacy (or both) while writing, depending on conditions of industrialization and commodification. Even as the teacher strove to deindustrialize work, commodification through grades and standardized assessments heightened alienation in the writing environment. The study provides an example of an educational context governed by an industrial system of assessment where local actors (the teacher and students) disrupted alienation by working in smaller scales and more closely with texts.\n",

    "Not My Circus, Not my Monkeys? Frontline Employee Perceptions of Customer Deviant Behaviors and Service Firms' Guardianship Policies": "Recent disruptions, labor shortages, and fiscal pressures, especially in retail service environments, have necessitated and highlighted changes in the roles and responsibilities of frontline employees, often requiring them to enforce mask mandates and police customer deviant behavior (CDB). While extant work has investigated the impact of policing, or guardianship, for customers and firms, there has been limited examination regarding the policies themselves and the corresponding toll exacted upon frontline employees (FLEs) and their managers (FLMs). Thus, this phenomenon warranted an in-depth, multi-method investigation, including a full-scale qualitative exploration substantiated and extended via three experiments and a survey. The qualitative approach probes employees' feelings about and identifies categories of CDB in retail service settings as well as develops a novel typology of guardianship policies (policy type x approach style). The subsequent studies empirically test the CDB guardianship typology in the context of a particularly detrimental type of CDB--shoplifting, while advancing understanding of firm-related (guardianship expectations), employee-related (trait anxiety) and job role-related (FLE vs FLM) contextual factors impacting perceptions of policy fairness and turnover intentions. The findings provide rich insights for practitioners and scholars by offering a novel guardianship typology and an extensive agenda for future research.\n",
    "Between Images": "Between Images proposes a unique theory of montage as a technique of relation: a means of fundamentally rethinking and reshaping how humans relate--to ourselves and each other, to the material world, to the planet and its nonhuman inhabitants. Historically, film criticism has cast montage in one of several roles: as narrative's invisible executor of spatiotemporal continuity to maintain the viewer's investment in the story-world; as an agent of disorder that confounds conventions of storytelling and realism and prompts the viewer's intellectual engagement; and as an expressionistic device for augmenting the duration and combination of shots to affect viewers at a sensory level. While not exactly abandoning such accounts, this study tries to move closer to the heart of montage by distinguishing the space between images as itself a powerful source of ideas, feelings, and forms. Venturing into an \"expanded field of montage\" beyond the limited purview of a given film's \"editing,\" Between Images traces the cut and the splice across photographic and cinematic media in a range of material, conceptual, and political contexts. In all of this, the space between images becomes a setting for navigating and renegotiating the terms of relation, of the \"being-with\" that connects all forms of life. Between Images brings together a diverse cast of experimental filmmakers, including Harun Farocki, Hito Steyerl, Steve McQueen, Cauleen Smith, Daichi Saito, and Ja'Tovia Gary, and in doing so, situates the cinematic cut within an interdisciplinary conversation about the abiding capacity of cinema to effect change.\n",

The results indicate that although external supply chain risk drivers do negatively impact a firm's financial performance, the influence of these risk events can be mitigated if firms adopt focused strategic practices. The results highlight the significant role played by CSR strategic practices in enabling firms to develop resilience from disruption events. In our research model, CSR, as an organizational linkage practice, is positioned in between upfront strategic flow and back-end performance flow. It suggests that CSR success is only possible when CSR is implemented broadly throughout organizational processes. Based on the empirical results, lessons and implications are presented for theoretical and managerial insights and future research.\n",
    "Life 24x a Second": "Life 24x a Second: Cinema, Selfhood, and Society is about the life-sustaining and life-affirming power of cinema. In confronting the devastating reality of the COVID-19 pandemic, the obligation to explain the value of all artistic expression and pedagogical practice has surely never been greater. This book adopts multiple perspectives on why films matter within and beyond the classroom, with special attention to hearing the sound tracks that move through bodies and that can be carried into the world at large. Drawing on work by authors across disparate fields of literature, business, psychology, biological science, autobiography, history, and cultural studies, this book makes the case for cinema as a life force on the biggest emotional, personal, and social terms, and in ways that can resonate for any reader. The book zeroes in on cinema that offers hope in relation to the Black Lives Matter movement (Imitation of Life (1959) and BlacKkKlansman (2018)); contemporary feminism (Nobody Knows (2004)); the teachings of Heartmath (Dancer in the Dark (2000)); realities of grief and mourning (Life of Pi (2012), Ikiru (1952), and A Star Is Born (2018)); and personal experiences of loss (Call Me By Your Name (2017) and Portrait of a Lady on Fire (2019)). Life 24x a Second: Cinema, Selfhood, and Society draws directly upon many pedagogical experiences and students' reflections to show how these films can create a better world for all.\n",
    "Identifying Healthcare Stereotype Threat in Older Gay Men Living with HIV": "Healthcare stereotype threat (HCST) is defined as \"being reduced to group stereotypes within an individual's healthcare encounter,\" leading to experiences of stigma and discrimination. This current study explores how older gay men living with HIV attribute their healthcare experiences to their social identities. Using HCST as a guiding framework, a content and structural coding analysis was conducted on transcripts from 11 interviews of older gay men living with HIV. The majority of HCST experiences were connected to the social identities of sexual orientation, HIV status, and age. Many of the healthcare experiences that participants discussed were related to interactions with healthcare providers and the attitudes of healthcare providers. This study illustrates how participants attributed social identities to healthcare experiences that showed qualities of HCST. These outcomes highlight how marginalized social identities impacted the lifetime healthcare experiences of this group of older gay men living with HIV.\n",
    "Rural Women, Creative Writing, and Resistance": "Blending narrative portraiture and feminist methods, this study explored the lives of two rural women who are creative writers. The study asked (1) What are their critical purposes? and (2) How did gender and place intersect in their writing lives? The findings were that the women used creative writing to engage in praxis by creating and disseminating knowledge. Their writing critically interrogated and redefined conceptions of womanhood. Additional critical purposes were unique to women's intersectional identities and lived experiences. They ranged from interrogating societal perspectives of gender, sexuality, and race to interrogating rurality and sexual violence. The aesthetic texts they created articulated and advocated for intersubjective truths. Shifting the focus of critical literacy from pedagogy and reading to writing beyond educational spaces, the women drew upon critical literacy not as a means of being taught how to understand the power of texts, but to wield the power of texts themselves.\n",
    "Zygomatic arch root position in relation to dietary type in haplorhine primates": "The zygomatic root, along with other key craniofacial features, is hypothesized to play a crucial role in strengthening the face in response to stresses and strains related to feeding. As such, it has been cited as indicative of dietary specialization among fossil taxa, although it remains unknown how variable zygomatic arch root position is among living primates, and whether its positioning predicts differences in diet. We test whether primates that consume more mechanically challenging foods possess more anteriorly positioned zygomatic roots compared to those consuming less challenging foods. Zygomatic root position, as defined by the zygomaxillare landmark, was identified and recorded from digital images and physical specimens of adult primate crania. Data were collected from 33 haplorhine species (n= 722). Published data were used to assign species to a dietary type based on patterns of overall consumption along with reliance on especially challenging foods. Pairwise comparisons between mechanically challenging (hard and/or tough) and less mechanically challenging (soft) consumers found significant differences (p< 0.05) in the position of the zygomatic root in 17 of 20 pairs, 11 of which supported the prediction that a more mechanically challenging diet is associated with a more anteriorly placed zygomatic root. PGLS analysis found no significant effect of phylogeny on root position. This suggests that a more anteriorly positioned zygomatic root is useful for identifying dietary specialization in some taxa but is not required for consuming a mechanically challenging diet given that other craniofacial and behavioral factors can facilitate the consumption of such foods.\n",
    "Firms' Response to Slacktivism: When and Why are E-Petitions Effective?": "E-petitions have evoked an important debate about the potential for digital activism to pressure firms to change social policies and practices. One prevailing perspective is that slacktivism, a tendency of online supporters to provide only token support, undermines any possible impact. An alternative perspective is that social media dynamics underlying digital activism offer new pathways for social activists to pressure firms toward social change. To explore this debate, we combine insights from research on social movements, social media, and the logic of connective action to theorize the impact of social media mechanisms such as e-petition connectivity and velocity. With a hand-coded database of 1587 e-petitions targeting Fortune 500 firms from 2012 to 2017 through the platformChange.org, we empirically evaluate whether these e-petitions matter. Our empirical results strongly suggest that e-petitions do matter, and we explain when digital activism has impact. The activation of social media mechanisms spreads negative information and directly intensifies the threat to the targeted firm's reputation, pressuring firms to concede to e-petitioner demands. Furthermore, our findings indicate that firm visibility and resource availability can represent boundary conditions for the firm's vulnerability and ability to respond to digital activism.\n",
    "Paving Behavior in Ants and Its Potential Application in Monitoring Two Urban Pest Ants, Solenopsis invicta and Tapinoma melanocephalum": "Our previous study discovered that two urban pest ants, red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), and ghost ants, Tapinoma melanocephalum (Fabricius) (Formicidae: Dolichoderinae), can pave viscose surfaces with particles to facilitate food search and transport. We hypothesize that this paving behavior can be applied to monitor S. invicta and T. melanocephalum. In the present study, 3998 adhesive tapes, each with a food source (sausage), were placed in 20 locations around Guangzhou, China (181-224 tapes per location), and their efficiency to detect S. invicta and T. melanocephalum was compared with two traditional ant-monitoring methods, baiting and pitfall trapping. Overall, S. invicta was detected by 45.6% and 46.4% of baits and adhesive tapes, respectively. In each location, the percentage of adhesive tapes detecting S. invicta and T. melanocephalum was similar when compared to baits and pitfall traps. However, significantly more non-target ant species showed up on bait and pitfall traps. Seven non-target ant species--Pheidole parva Mayr (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole nodus Smith (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole sinica Wu & Wang (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Pheidole yeensis Forel (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Carebara affinis (Jerdon) (Formicidae: Myrmicinae), Camponotus nicobarensis Mayr (Formicidae: Formicinae), and Odontoponera transversa (Smith) (Formicidae: Ponerinae)--also showed tape paving behavior, but they can be easily distinguished morphologically from S. invicta and T. melanocephalum. Our study showed that the paving behavior occurs in different subfamilies of ants (i.e., myrmicinae, dolichoderinae, formicinae, and ponerinae). In addition, paving behavior can potentially be used to develop more specific monitoring methods for S. invicta and T. melanocephalum in urban areas in southern China.\n",
    "Novel Intra- Operative Wound Irrigation Solution to Manage Infection Prevention in Patients Undergoing Primary Joint Arthroplasty: Retrospective Review of a Case Series of 308 Patients": "## Introduction:\nPeriprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total hip and total knee arthroplasty is a devastating complication that is known to be associated with costly, resource-intensive interventions that place a significant burden on the US healthcare system. Estimated average hospital costs to treat female patients with PJI after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) in 2018 was $27,307, and $32,956 respectively. While the average costs to treat male patients with PJI after TKA or THA was $27,097 and $33,090 respectively. One strategy aimed at preventing PJI after total joint arthroplasty is the use of an intra-operative wound irrigation with an antiseptic solution. This retrospective case review was conducted to assess the incidence of PJI after using a novel wound antiseptic irrigation solution in patients undergoing primary TKA and THA.\n\n## Methods:\nThe CDC defines surgical site infections, (SSI) as infections that occur after the surgery. The infections are further categorized as superficial involving the skin, or deep tissue. These infections are then divided into; superficial incisional SSI, deep incisional SSI, and organ-space SSI. In a study by Kannan et al., SSIs are more commonly seen in patients with more comorbidities. A consecutive series of 308 high-risk patients undergoing primary TKA or THA between January 4, 2021 and August 30, 2021, in whom Prontosan(r) Wound Irrigation Solution (B. Braun Medical Inc./ Innovice LLC), containing 0.1% Betaine, a surfactant, and 0.1% Polyhexanide (PHMB) was added to the intra-operative procedure, were evaluated for its impact on the incidence of PJI. The CDC's Surgical Care Improvement Project, (SCIP) guidelines are standard of care and followed with each surgical procedure. The CDC recommends using antimicrobial prophylaxis at a time before skin incision such that the antibiotic concentration reaches the minimum bactericidal concentration at the time of skin incision, Berrios-Torres SI, et al. All data were prospectively submitted to the American Joint Replacement Registry (AJRR) was retrospectively analyzed to measure the incidence of postoperative infection.\n\n## Results:\nPrimary TJA was performed on 308 patients; of these 10 patients were bilateral TKA (205 TKA procedures and 113 THA procedures). The use of Prontosan(r) Wound Irrigation Solution was associated with zero (0%) incidence of postoperative infection in this population of patients during a 90-day episode of care, nor at any time postoperatively. CMS defines total joint arthroplasty codes as a major surgery, and encounters or procedures within 90 days of the initiating procedure are included in the 90-day episode of care. No patients were lost to follow-up.\n\n## Conclusion:\nThere was no incidence of PJI uncovered in this retrospective analysis. Adding Prontosan(r) Wound Irrigation Solution to the intra-operative protocol, contributed to the absence of PJI in this population and potentially avoided 1.74 female and 1.34 male TKA as well as .95 female and .75 THA resulting in total hospital-avoided costs of $83,824 and $56,126, respectively totaling $139,950.\n",
    "Evidence-Based Strategies to Reduce Anxiety in Students With Autism Spectrum Disorder": "Students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience anxiety at higher rates than their neurotypical peers, which can negatively impact school performance. Anxiety symptoms for these students can be challenging to identify because they mimic diagnostic characteristics. As key intervention team members, school-based mental health professionals can assist with identifying and addressing anxiety in students with autism. Specific evidence-based strategies for school-based mental health professionals are detailed to support efforts to intervene successfully with students with autism who experience anxiety.\n",
    "Estimating habit-forming and variety-seeking behavior: Valuation of recreational birdwatching": "Past experiences influence choices, and people's preferences for more similar (habit-forming) or different (variety-seeking) experiences are reflected in these choices. We develop a structural estimation framework to capture whether people are habit forming or variety seeking and apply it to the choice of recreation site. This research contributes to the revealed preference literature by demonstrating how to account for habit or variety-seeking behavior in recreation site choice models in a two-stage framework. Using this framework, we estimate similarity weights that reflect the birders habit formation and variety seeking preferences. Predicted probabilities from the first stage model are then incorporated into the second stage, a mixed logit recreation site choice model of bird watching trips from eBird, by their members. We find that including the dynamic elements of choice, specifically variety-seeking behavior, can double the estimated willingness to pay (WTP) for individual sites relative to the static model. Although our sample of bird watching trips taken by eBird members is a sample of convenience, these results suggest that static models of recreation site choice are a lower bound on our recreation demand WTP estimates. We find variety-seeking preferences are related to land cover and the site's fixed attributes, whereas habit formation appears for seasonality in the bird watching context.\n",
    "Understanding Libraries as Part of the Rural Active Living Environment: Evidence From a Content Analysis of Library Facebook Posts Made in Summer 2022": "As both public health and public libraries continue to evolve, there are opportunities for collaboration focused on building policies, systems, and environments that support communities making healthy choices easy choices. Given the health disparities related to physical inactivity, such as diabetes and heart disease in rural America, public libraries within rural communities are emerging as important settings for health promotion and disease prevention. This study sought to better understand how rural libraries promote physical activity opportunities on Facebook. Based on a content analysis of Facebook posts of a random sample of 118 libraries made during the Summer of 2022, 47 of the 118 had at least one post related to physical activity and 42 had multiple posts. The most frequent offering was events or classes; libraries also supported physical activity by lending equipment and making changes to the built environment. This study provides evidence that some rural libraries are offering physical activity opportunities through community health partnerships, particularly for youth and families. Considering this evidence, public health professionals are encouraged to collaborate with local libraries to promote physical activity and advance rural health equity. Researchers are invited to continue to develop the evidence base around promoting physical activity with rural libraries.\n",
    "Then and now: A 50-year retrospective thematic analysis of Society for Community Research and Action presidential addresses": "The Society for Community Research and Action (SCRA) is the primary professional home for community psychologists in the United States and increasingly around the world. Since the formation of the American Psychological Association Division 27: Community Psychology in 1966, now SCRA, 54 people have served in the Presidential role. Presidential leaders' annual addresses both reflect the current state of the field and have the ability to shape the future of both SCRA as an organization and community psychology as a discipline given their positions as leaders. This commentary explores the trajectory of SCRA as an organization via 33 available presidential addresses, 28 of which were published in theAmerican Journal of Community Psychology(AJCP). Using thematic analysis and drawing on both dialectical and life cycle organizational processes, three periods of SCRA and community psychology more broadly were identified:defining community psychology,applying community psychology, andre-imagining community psychology. Themes speak to tensions between the ideals of the society and the work of the society. We conclude by offering a series of questions for consideration as SCRA positions itself for the future.\n",
    "Risk and Revenue Management in the Chinese Auto Loan Industry": "The automobile consumption credit business promotes the development of the automobile industry. However, the current credit system in China requires further refinement. Thus, the credit loan business is associated with certain risks, and company profits are often negatively impacted by clients who default on loans. Based on the data, this article leverages the economic and financial theories of consumer credit risk control to construct a logistic model to predict customers' default probability. Then, a quadratic regression model is established to determine the optimal commission structure to balance profitability with incentives from retail stores. Results show that the macro-level variables are negatively associated with the probability of good behavior. The personal level variables exhibit a positive association. In addition, a negative coefficient in the quadratic profit equation indicates the presence of an inverted \"U\" relationship between profit and commission. Corresponding suggestions are put forward.\n",
    "Value of corporate political contributions from the investors' perspective": "In this study we consider corporate political contributions as a special type of social capital reserved for future contingencies. Firms benefit from making such contributions when the government suddenly intervenes in the market. We explore this value-creation mechanism in terms of the firm-investor relationship, not in terms of the traditional firm-government relationship. When a government intervention is being proposed or approved, firms that have made political contributions coordinating with political candidates are likely to enjoy better stock market returns than those that have not made such contributions. We also argue that firms that have made political contributions may experience lower stock returns than those that have not when the intervention plan is rejected. By focusing on the U.S. government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) of 2008, our event study analysis with three news announcements finds that financial institutions that made political action committee (PAC) contributions indeed enjoyed higher stock returns when TARP was proposed and eventually approved. However, we do not find support for the investors' devaluation of political contributions when TARP was once rejected during the review process. The findings propose that managers can use corporate political contributions as a strategic option to help investors reduce investment uncertainty by presenting their readiness for any unexpected change in the regulatory environment.\n",
    "\"Helicase\" activity promoted through dynamic interactions between a ssDNA translocase and a diffusing SSB protein": "Replication protein A (RPA) is a eukaryotic single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding (SSB) protein that is essential for all aspects of genome maintenance. RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity but can also diffuse along ssDNA. By itself, RPA is capable of transiently disrupting short regions of duplex DNA by diffusing from a ssDNA that flanks the duplex DNA. Using single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence and optical trapping combined with fluorescence approaches, we show thatS. cerevisiaePif1 can use its ATP-dependent 5' to 3' translocase activity to chemomechanically push a single human RPA (hRPA) heterotrimer directionally along ssDNA at rates comparable to those of Pif1 translocation alone. We further show that using its translocation activity, Pif1 can push hRPA from a ssDNA loading site into a duplex DNA causing stable disruption of at least 9 bp of duplex DNA. These results highlight the dynamic nature of hRPA enabling it to be readily reorganized even when bound tightly to ssDNA and demonstrate a mechanism by which directional DNA unwinding can be achieved through the combined action of a ssDNA translocase that pushes an SSB protein. These results highlight the two basic requirements for any processive DNA helicase: transient DNA base pair melting (supplied by hRPA) and ATP-dependent directional ssDNA translocation (supplied by Pif1) and that these functions can be unlinked by using two separate proteins.\n",
    "Hand preference in wild crab-eating capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) in the coastal area of Northest Brazil": "Handedness is a fundamental human trait, although recent research, especially on nonhuman primates, has shown that it is displayed by other animals as well (e.g., chimpanzees, gorillas). In this study, we explore hand preference in wild crab-eating tufted capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) inhabiting a mangrove forest located on the coastal area of Northeast Brazil (Maranhao State). Tufted capuchin monkeys at our site use facultatively wooden tools to crack open crabs. We observed hand preference in 12 subjects who spontaneously participated in experiment sessions, in which we provided crabs and tools on wooden platforms. We recorded (using events and bouts) two unimanual tasks, (tool or crab) grabbing and (tool or crab) pounding, and one bimanual task, crab pulling, where one hand kept the crab in place while the other pulled off parts of the crab. Hand preference increased with greater strength needed to perform the task and its complexity. While only 17%-25% of capuchins showed hand preference during grabbing, 44%-64% showed hand preference during pounding, and most subjects 64%-80% displayed a right-hand preference when performing the bimanual task, for which all lateralized individuals were right-handed. Hand preference did not vary between adults and juvenile individuals and was not consistent across tasks. Group-level hand preference was found only for the bimanual task, for which all lateralized individuals were right-handed. Our findings are in concordance with those of other primate studies showing the emergence of hemispheric specialization for bimanual actions, highlight the importance of conducting such studies on diverse type of tasks, and show the feasibility to conduct experimental manipulation under natural conditions.\n",

    "Opioid and Non-Opioid Pharmacotherapy Use for Pain Management Among Privately Insured Pediatric Patients With Cancer in the United States": "## Background:\nThis study examined the trends and patterns of opioid and non-opioid pharmacotherapy use among a large national sample of privately insured pediatric patients with cancer in the United States.\n\n## Materials and Methods:\nWe identified pediatric (aged &lt; 21) patients diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS), lymphoma, gonadal, leukemia, or bone cancer from MarketScan data 2005-2019. We examined the proportion of patients who filled a prescription for the following 5 types of pharmacotherapy: opioid, anticonvulsant, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), antidepressant, and muscle relaxant during active cancer treatment. We assessed the trends and patterns in pharmacotherapy using multivariable logistic regressions.\n\n## Results:\nAmong 4174 patients included, 2979 (71%) had an opioid prescription; 746 (18%), 384 (9%), 202 (5%), and 169 (4%) had anticonvulsant, NSAID, antidepressant and muscle relaxant prescriptions, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression showed a nonlinear trend in the use of opioids among pediatric patients with cancer over time such that use slightly increased until 2012 (OR of 1.40 [95% CI, 1.12-1.73] for 2012 vs. 2006) but then decreased thereafter (OR of 0.51 [0.37-0.68] for 2018 vs. 2012). The use of anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, and muscle relaxants increased significantly linearly over time (all P &lt; .005).\n\n## Conclusion:\nThere has been a downward trend in the use of opioids in recent years among pediatric patients with cancer and an upward trend in the use of non-opioid pharmacotherapy for pain management potentially as an alternative to opioids.\n",
    "Usurpation and Brooding of Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) Chicks by Common Terns (Sterna hirundo)": "While nest usurpation and subsequent incubation of eggs and even brooding of chicks from other species has been reported for Common Terns (Sterna hirundo), such behavior is considered rare. We report an observation of a Common Tern pair usurping the Least Tern (Sternula antillarum) nest and brooding the Least Tern chicks. While the Least Tern pair attempted to provide care for the chicks, the Common Terns displayed aggressive behavior and defended the nest. Though both species attempted to feed the chicks, no feeding events were observed due to harassment from the other species. Neither pair was observed nesting prior to or following this event, and all chicks are believed to have been lost to predation. We discuss the possible scenarios leading to the observed usurpation event, the possibility that usurpations are more common than previously believed, and the need for different monitoring methods to elucidate the causes of usurpations.\n",
    "Is the future female for turtles? Climate change and wetland configuration predict sex ratios of a freshwater species": "Climate change and land-use change are leading drivers of biodiversity decline, affecting demographic parameters that are important for population persistence. For example, scientists have speculated for decades that climate change may skew adult sex ratios in taxa that express temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), but limited evidence exists that this phenomenon is occurring in natural settings. For species that are vulnerable to anthropogenic land-use practices, differential mortality among sexes may also skew sex ratios. We sampled the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), a freshwater species with TSD, across a large portion of its geographic range (Florida to Maine), to assess the environmental factors influencing adult sex ratios. We present evidence that suggests recent climate change has potentially skewed the adult sex ratio of spotted turtles, with samples following a pattern of increased proportions of females concomitant with warming trends, but only within the warmer areas sampled. At intermediate temperatures, there was no relationship with climate, while in the cooler areas we found the opposite pattern, with samples becoming more male biased with increasing temperatures. These patterns might be explained in part by variation in relative adaptive capacity via phenotypic plasticity in nest site selection. Our findings also suggest that spotted turtles have a context-dependent and multi-scale relationship with land use. We observed a negative relationship between male proportion and the amount of crop cover (within 300 m) when wetlands were less spatially aggregated. However, when wetlands were aggregated, sex ratios remained consistent. This pattern may reflect sex-specific patterns in movement that render males more vulnerable to mortality from agricultural machinery and other threats. Our findings highlight the complexity of species' responses to both climate change and land use, and emphasize the role that landscape structure can play in shaping wildlife population demographics.\n",
    "Extensive regional variation in the phenology of insects and their response to temperature across North America": "Climate change models often assume similar responses to temperatures across the range of a species, but local adaptation or phenotypic plasticity can lead plants and animals to respond differently to temperature in different parts of their range. To date, there have been few tests of this assumption at the scale of continents, so it is unclear if this is a large-scale problem. Here, we examined the assumption that insect taxa show similar responses to temperature at 96 sites in grassy habitats across North America. We sampled insects with Malaise traps during 2019-2021 (N= 1041 samples) and examined the biomass of insects in relation to temperature and time of season. Our samples mostly contained Diptera (33%), Lepidoptera (19%), Hymenoptera (18%), and Coleoptera (10%). We found strong regional differences in the phenology of insects and their response to temperature, even within the same taxonomic group, habitat type, and time of season. For example, the biomass of nematoceran flies increased across the season in the central part of the continent, but it only showed a small increase in the Northeast and a seasonal decline in the Southeast and West. At a smaller scale, insect biomass at different traps operating on the same days was correlated up to ~75 km apart. Large-scale geographic and phenological variation in insect biomass and abundance has not been studied well, and it is a major source of controversy in previous analyses of insect declines that have aggregated studies from different locations and time periods. Our study illustrates that large-scale predictions about changes in insect populations, and their causes, will need to incorporate regional and taxonomic differences in the response to temperature.\n",
    "Incapacitated and/or Forcible Rape Experience Predicting College Women's Rape Victim Empathy": "Rape experience is common and victim empathy may help address it (e.g., prevention, victim support). We examined rape victim empathy based on type of rape experience (none, incapacitated, forcible, combined). Undergraduate women ( n = 658) completed the Rape Victim Empathy-During Subscale and Sexual Experiences Survey-Short Form Victimization. Rape experience was associated with greater empathy, especially for those with any forcible experience. Perhaps due to weaker memory of their own rape event, incapacitated victims may be relatively less able than forcible victims to understand another victim's perspective during a rape. Researchers should consider examining incapacitated and forcible rape as distinct experiences.\n",

    "Bioabsorbable, subcutaneous naltrexone implants mitigate fentanyl-induced respiratory depression at 3 months--A pilot study in male canines": "The aim of this study is to determine if extended-release, bioabsorbable, subcutaneous naltrexone (NTX) implants can mitigate respiratory depression after an intravenous injection (IV) of fentanyl. Six different BIOabsorbable Polymeric Implant Naltrexone (BIOPIN) formulations, comprising combinations of Poly-d,l-Lactic Acid (PDLLA) and/or Polycaprolactone (PCL-1 or PCL-2), were used to create subcutaneous implants. Both placebo and naltrexone implants were implanted subcutaneously in male dogs. The active naltrexone implants consisted of two doses, 644 mg and 1288 mg. A challenge with IV fentanyl was performed in 33 male dogs at 97-100 days after implantation. Following the administration of a 30 mg/kg intravenous fentanyl dose, the placebo cohort manifested a swift and profound respiratory depression with a ~50% reduction in their pre-dose respiratory rate (RR). The BIOPIN NTX-implanted dogs were exposed to escalating doses of intravenous fentanyl (30 mg/kg, 60 mg/kg, 90 mg/kg, and 120 mg/kg). In contrast, the dogs implanted with the BIOPIN naltrexone implants tolerated doses up to 60 mg/kg without significant respiratory depression (<50%) but had severe respiratory depression with fentanyl doses of 90 mg/kg and especially at 120 mg/kg. Bioabsorbable, extended-release BIOPIN naltrexone implants are effective in mitigating fentanyl-induced respiratory depression in male canines at about 3 months after implantation. This technology may also have potential for mitigating fentanyl-induced respiratory depression in humans.\n",

    "COVID-19 and its impact on multinational enterprises: A modified value at risk approach": "Multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating across different currencies are exposed to exchange rate risk. They may utilize a variety of tools to mitigate that risk. While there are different types of exchange rate risk, this study focuses specifically on the ongoing exposure of cash flow transactions denominated in the currencies of seven different developed countries. Since other types of risk (i.e., economic and translation) are evaluated based on yearly results, they are not considered in this study. Themodifiedvalue-at-risk (MVaR) model is employed to estimate the maximum one-period losses during the eighteen months before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and, in addition, the maximum one-period losses during the eighteen months following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The predicted losses using MVaR are then compared with the actual ex-post results. Our objective is to analyze the extent of the cash flow transaction exposure and provide practical insights to MNEs as they decide whether or not they should hedge this risk. This study is noteworthy because it compares the pre- and post-COVID-19 periods.\n",
    "An Argument for Expanding Research on Quantitative Pedagogical Content Knowledge": "Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) traditionally has been used in research concerning prospective and practicing classroom teachers. This essay argues that PCK is also relevant to other professions including those advancing quantitative reasoning (QR). To illustrate, the case of PCK for teaching QR is considered. Those in fields such as public health, journalism, meteorology, and government increasingly find themselves responsible for helping the public understand an ever-growing amount of quantitative information that has a bearing on societal well-being. Several examples illustrate how such professionals' responsibilities require knowing prevalent QR patterns in society, strategies for fostering sound reasoning, and the general nature of school curricula. Professional organizations in education, colleges of education, and educational researchers would benefit from expanding PCK research to encompass multiple professions. These expanded research and development efforts would simultaneously address urgent societal needs.\n",
    "Remembering my friend and rehearing two films": "This article revolves around two soundtracks Walker has admired along with the person to whom this issue of Alphaville is dedicated: Danijela Kulezic-Wilson. The soundtracks come from Soul by Pete Docter and Kemp Powers and Nomadland by Chloe Zhao, both released in 2020. The films are sonically worlds apart: Soul is dominated by jazz music by Jon Batiste and contemporary electronic music by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, while Nomadland features modern classical music by Ludovico Einaudi and Olafur Arnalds. Ironically, despite sounding profoundly different, both films draw from true stories in order to teach audioviewers about living well, even in the midst of death. Or, to reapply Danijela's words about Waking Life (Richard Linklater, 2001), these films emphasise \"the dualistic nature of human experience, the pleasure of being alive and the implicit proximity of death.\" Walker combines cinematherapy with sound studies to make a case for the wisdom of both films that have helped her cope with the grief of Danijela's death, in the hope that this might resonate for those readers who find similar comfort in their own film-to-person relationships.\n",
    "Bridging the gap in early career teachers' STEM pedagogy: Exploring micro-credentials as a possible creative solution": "This exploratory study sought to address the gap in strengthening science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) teacher preparation in elementary and secondary teacher education programs. Integrated STEM education is attracting increased attention and gaining momentum from educators, politicians, STEM industries, and the media across the nation. Many state and national organizations have called for a new workforce of problem solvers, innovators, and inventors who are self-reliant and able to think logically, also suggesting that creating such capacity is one of the critical foundations that drive innovative capacity in the nation. A key to developing these skills is STEM competencies and career goals in every K-12 student. To do this, teachers must be educated on how to connect STEM careers and integrate STEM content into their curriculum. Providing integrated STEM micro-credentials for preservice and in-service teachers can be a flexible solution for providing teachers a method to learn how to improve their content knowledge and pedagogy (Digital Promise, 2019). Participants were a combination of undergraduate preservice teachers and graduate early-career teachers who were asked about their STEM preparation. The majority of the participants received very little to no integrated STEM preparation. As a possible solution for this, participants were asked about their preferred type of professional development (PD) and if participating in a micro-credential course would be a possibility. Nearly all of the participants agreed that a self-paced micro-credential that blended online and in-person instruction would be something they would do to learn how to integrate STEM more effectively into their pedagogy. Micro-credentials could be a successful solution for educator PD.\n",
    "Of shepherds and sheep: Who sets the agenda for firms' attention to social issues?": "Corporate social responsibility has received much attention regarding how it can benefit firms and why firms voluntarily address social issues. However, little is known about the problems to which firms choose to pay attention and what influences these decisions. We combine the attention-based view of the firm and media agenda-setting theories to propose that firms address the most prominent social issues as determined by the media. We analyze the frequency of 64 social issues in the CSR reports of 258 firms from 2006 to 2016 for a total sample of 86,208 issue-firm-year observations. We find that the salience of the problems in traditional media influences the social issues firms address in their CSR reports, and over time, the agenda-setting effect of traditional media on firms has increased, solidifying traditional media's role as curators of social issues.\n",
    "Continuous Wavelet Transform Analysis of Climate Variability, Resiliency, and Restoration Strategies in Mesohaline Tidal Creeks": "This research article employs the continuous wavelet transform analysis to identify the climatological effects among various water quality parameters to identify the successfulness of upland stream restoration on the receiving mesohaline tidal creeks. Estuaries and their corresponding tidal creeks have been impacted by human anthropogenic influences for decades, allowing a variety of restoration practices to be implemented in upland streams. In the face of climate variability and continuous human development pressures, this research performs statistical analysis and a wavelet coherence on, before, and after stream restoration for water quality changes in Chesapeake Bay's tidal tributaries in the Lower Western Shore to identify if the restoration strategies have been effective in the mesohaline tidal creeks. Statistical analysis showed that currently, the receiving tidal basins are not seeing the required positive improvements in water quality after years of upland stream restoration. Compounding this is the fact climate variability cannot be ignored. Results indicate that the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) has significant wavelet coherence with bottom dissolved oxygen, precipitation, and nutrients. This suggests that current restoration efforts may not be able to keep up with climate variability, and other techniques (restoration or policies) may need to be implemented.\n",
    "The Impact of Physical Activity Enjoyment, Exercise Self-Efficacy, Recording Physical Activity, and Exercise Goal Setting on Physical Activity Levels of College Students": "Physical inactivity has been established to be problematic for college students both short- and long-term. Their participation in physical activity (PA) is influenced by many factors which will be explored in this study. The purpose of the study was to examine the interrelationships of PA enjoyment, exercise goal setting, exercise self-efficacy, and recording PA behaviors and the impact on PA. One thousand four hundred and seventy-six students at a public university in the United States responded to a questionnaire consisting of validated survey instruments regarding PA levels and exercise behaviors between 2014 and 2018. Exercise self-efficacy, PA enjoyment and recording PA were direct positive predictors of PA. Our findings reinforce the positive influence between PA enjoyment, exercise self-efficacy, and establishing exercise goals with increased PA. Particularly, exercise goal setting and PA enjoyment not only directly impact PA but also influence other model variables, underscoring their significance in enhancing PA among college students.\n",
    "12th Grade Female Student Perceived Value, Achievement, Cost and Self-Regulated Engagement Associated with Serious Simulation Game Level Attainment": "Little is known about the motivational factors or design features that might lead female career and technical education (CTE) health sciences students to persist in self-regulated engagement to win state achievement in serious simulation games (SSGs). In this study, 12thgrade female CTE health sciences students played a 3-Level hand hygiene SSG that was developed based on a learner analysis of a prior cohort of students. A within-subjects repeated measures design was used to assess differences in student motivation using a 10-construct Value-Achievement-Cost\n (VAC) Survey between baseline and the time they exited the SSG. Student choice to persistently engage in each level of the SSG was also evaluated using a 10-item SSG design feature score board. The average time that the Level III achievement students were engaged in the SSG was twice as long\n as Level I/II achievement students. Three of the 4 perceived mean Cost construct scores significantly decreased with large effect from baseline for students who persisted to the SSG Level III win state while all pre-post Value and Achievement orientation constructs scores remained unchanged.\n Mean average differences were not statistically significant for any of the ten core SSG design elements regardless of engagement time.\n",
    "Bill shape reflects divergent prey consumption for island compared to mainland American kestrels (Falco sparverius)": "Feeding morphology permits animals to adapt to changing environments and is often under strong selection. We evaluated if bill shape varies according to differences in dietary prey taken across geographical ranges (North America, Central America, South America, and Caribbean islands) in a ubiquitous, New World raptor species, the American kestrel (Falco sparverius). Specifically, we predicted that bills in geographies where kestrels consumed a larger proportion of vertebrates would be shorter and wider, with a larger tomial tooth. We reviewed the literature on kestrel diets across their range and quantified potential differences in bill shape using geometric morphometric methods for 245 museum specimens. The literature review revealed that most prey consumed by kestrels in North, South, and Central America were invertebrates (51.6-69.1%), whereas Caribbean kestrels consumed mostly vertebrates (61.4%), most of which were reptiles (77.3%). Morphometric analyses agreed with these findings; bill shape differed for island versus mainland kestrels but not among mainland regions. Bill shape on islands reflected a more robust bill with a larger tomial tooth, but had a longer hook, which we suggest is adaptive for consumption of lizard prey, more available on islands due to reduced competition with other raptors compared to mainland regions.\n",
    "Inefficiencies and bias in first job placement: The case of professional Asian nationals in the United States": "We study whether the quality of the first job is lower for professional Asian nationals than for non-Asian nationals in the USA. With over a million professionals from Asia entering the US labor market in the past decade, a potential under placement may be both inefficient and discriminatory. We collected data on all newly hired assistant professors of management in research-intensive (R1) universities in the USA between 2010 and 2021. We focus on the quality of the university into which first hires are placed and examine whether first-job placement quality is lower for individuals who were born in East, South and Southeast Asia. We find that the quality and quantity of publication record are positively related to the quality of the placement and that Asian nationals have higher performance. However, Asian nationals are placed at lower-quality universities relative to their peers. Further, Asian nationals require a strong performance signal, in the form of first or second authorship on a publication to narrow the placement gap. Our results are explained by a combination of direct bias against applicants of Asian nationality and a requirement of a higher performance \"burden of proof\" from these applicants, compared to peers who are non-Asian nationals.\n",
    "Studying U.S. college faculty during the COVID-19 pandemic: Perceptions of severity, concerns, sources of information, preventive behaviors, barriers to work performance, and impact on work productivity": "This study examined perceptions of and experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic among 489 faculty from four public universities in the southeast United States. Data were collected via an online survey during the Fall 2020 semester, when campuses re-opened after closing in March. Two thirds of faculty perceived the severity of COVID-19 as severe, and their greatest concerns related to preventive behaviors, the possibility of a virus resurgence, and concern for the health of family/friends. The majority reported frequently engaging in COVID-19-preventing behaviors, which was highest among female and older faculty, and those with higher perceived severity and concern for personally contracting the virus. Over half of respondents reported teaching and scholarly activities were negatively impacted by the pandemic; most notable barriers to productivity included anxiety/stress and a distracted home environment. The study adds to the research on university faculty during the pandemic and aligns with research on the adult population.\n",
    "Factors Associated With Leisure-Time Bicycling Among Adults in the United States: An Urban-Rural Comparison": "Background:Bicycling is a healthy form of physical activity that can be performed by most adults as part of leisure-time (LT) activity. However, little is known about LT bicycling behaviors, especially in the rural areas of the United States. This study sought to contrast the prevalence and factors associated with LT bicycling in populations living in urban settings with those living in rural settings.Methods:The 2019 Behavior Risk Factor Survey, which contains information regarding LT physical activity behaviors among adults (N = 396,261) in the United States, was used to determine the prevalence, demographic profile, and likelihood of meeting the physical activity guidelines of LT bicyclists. The 2013 National Center for Health Statistics Urban/Rural Classification Scheme was used to classify respondents living in rural and urban settings.Results:Among US adults, 3.8% (95% CI, 3.7-3.9) reported LT bicycling activity, the sixth most common physical activity. Adults living in urban counties compared with rural counties had a greater prevalence of LT bicycling (3.9% vs 2.3%, respectively), with adults living in rural counties having a 34% lower probability of LT bicycling. Rural bicycling prevalence rates were lower across all demographics. Urban bicyclists, compared with rural bicyclists, cycled more months of the year. Overall, 85.5% of all bicyclists met the aerobic physical guidelines, with no differences between urban and rural bicyclists.Conclusions:Bicycling remains an important LT physical activity among adults in the United States. However, a rural-urban difference in the prevalence does exist for LT bicycling. The reasons for this disparity warrant further investigation.\n",
    "Opioid Overdose Hospitalizations During COVID-19: The Experience of Pennsylvania": "## Objective:\nThe COVID-19 pandemic placed extreme burden on hospitals, while opioid overdose is another challenging public health issue. This study aimed to examine the trends and outcomes of opioid overdose hospitalizations in Pennsylvania during 2018 to 2021.\n\n## Design:\nWe identified opioid overdose hospitalizations in the state of Pennsylvania using the state-wide hospital discharge database (PHC4) 2018 to 2021. We examined the number of opioid overdose hospitalizations, the corresponding mortality and discharges against medical advice comparing the pre-COVID period (2018-2019) and the COVID period (2020-2021). We also assessed what patient and hospital characteristics were associated with in-hospital death or leaving against medical advice.\n\n## Results:\nA total of 13 446 opioid-related hospitalizations were identified in 2018 to 2021. Compared to pre-pandemic, a higher percentage of cases involving synthetics (17.0%vs 10.3%, P < .0001) were observed during COVID. After controlling for covariates, there was no significant difference in opioid overdose in-hospital deaths in the years 2020 to 2021 compared to 2018 to 2019 (OR = 0.846, 95% CI: 0.71-1.01, P = .065). The COVID period was significantly associated with more leaving against medical advice compared to years 2018 to 2019 (OR = 1.265, 95% CI: 1.11-1.44, P = .0003). Compared to commercial insurance, Medicaid insurance was associated with higher odds of both in-hospital death (OR = 1.383, 95% CI: 1.06-1.81, P = .0176) and leaving against medical advice (OR = 1.903, 95% CI: 1.56-2.33, P < .0001).\n\n## Conclusion:\nThere were no substantial changes in the number of overall opioid overdose cases and deaths at hospitals following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. This observation suggests that an increased number of patients may have succumbed to overdoses outside of hospital settings, possibly due to a higher severity of overdoses. Further, we found that patients were more likely to leave against medical advice during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "Ecological differentiation and sympatry of cryptic species in the Sphagnum magellanicum complex (Bryophyta)": "## Premise:\nSphagnum magellanicum(Sphagnaceae, Bryophyta) has been considered to be a single semi-cosmopolitan species, but recent molecular analyses have shown that it comprises a complex of at least seven reciprocally monophyletic groups, that are difficult or impossible to distinguish morphologically.\n\n## Methods:\nNewly developed barcode markers and RADseq analyses were used to identify species among 808 samples from 119 sites. Molecular approaches were used to assess the geographic ranges of four North American species, the frequency at which they occur sympatrically, and ecological differentiation among them. Microhabitats were classified with regard to hydrology and shade. Hierarchical modelling of species communities was used to assess climate variation among the species. Climate niches were projected back to 22,000 years BP to assess the likelihood that the North American species had sympatric ranges during the late Pleistocene.\n\n## Results:\nThe species exhibited parallel morphological variation, making them extremely difficult to distinguish phenotypically. Two to three species frequently co-occurred within peatlands. They had broadly overlapping microhabitat and climate niches. Barcode- versus RADseq-based identifications were in conflict for 6% of the samples and always involvedS. diabolicumvs.S. magniae.\n\n## Conclusions:\nThese species co-occur within peatlands at scales that could permit interbreeding, yet they remain largely distinct genetically and phylogenetically. The four cryptic species exhibited distinct geographic and ecological patterns. Conflicting identifications from barcode vs. RADseq analyses forS. diabolicumversusS. magniaecould reflect incomplete speciation or hybridization. They comprise a valuable study system for additional work on climate adaptation.\n",
    "Towards Recognizing Food Types for Unseen Subjects": "Recognizing food types through sensor signals for unseen users remains remarkably challenging, despite extensive recent studies. The efficacy of prior machine learning techniques is dwarfed by giant variations of data collected from multiple participants, partly because users have varied chewing habits and wear sensor devices in various manners. This work treats the problem as an instance of the domain adaptation problem, where each user represents a domain. We develop the first multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) method for food-typing recognition, which consists of three major components: stratified normalization, a multi-source domain adaptor, and adaptive ensemble learning. New techniques are developed for each component. Using a real-world dataset comprised of 15 participants, we demonstrate that our method achieves\\(1.33\\times\\)to\\(2.13\\times\\)improvement in accuracy compared with nine state-of-the-art MSDA baselines. Additionally, we perform an in-depth ablation study to examine the behavior of each component and confirm their efficacy.\n"
