    "detailed_summary": "This paper provides empirical evidence regarding the impact of corporate label changes (CLC) on investor reactions, grounded in stakeholder theory and resource-based theory. It examines how firm-level characteristics such as size and age influence shareholder responses, while also testing the moderating effects of firm performance. Using data from South Korean companies, the authors calculate cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) and employ ordinary least squares regressions to analyze the data. The findings reveal that CLC does not significantly affect shareholder value; however, larger and older firms tend to receive more favorable investor reactions. Interestingly, the impact of firm size on shareholder reactions diminishes when firms perform well. The study acknowledges limitations, including the generalizability of findings and the exclusion of certain types of CLCs. Practically, it suggests that managers should be cautious when considering label changes, especially in light of potential losses. The research fills a gap in the literature by focusing on external stakeholder reactions, particularly from investors, and offers valuable insights for managerial decision-making regarding corporate identity strategies."
