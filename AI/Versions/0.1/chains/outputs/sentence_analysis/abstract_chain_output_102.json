    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates how objective and subjective financial well-being relate to depression symptoms in Chinese older adults, utilizing data from the Harmonized China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study over two waves (2015 and 2018). It employs two financial ratios to measure objective financial well-being and perceived money management difficulty for subjective well-being, alongside the CES-D scale for depression symptoms. The analysis utilizes three models, revealing that a higher expenditure-to-income ratio correlates positively with depression, while the financial assets ratio negatively impacts depression. A robustness check confirms that meeting financial thresholds is associated with lower depression, and perceived difficulty in money management contributes positively to depression. However, in a fixed effects model, the financial ratios showed no significance, attributed to data limitations. The findings underscore the importance of both financial well-being aspects in mental health, suggesting that policy developments are necessary to enhance financial services and mental health support for the elderly in China."
