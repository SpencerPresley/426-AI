    "detailed_summary": "This study examines the effects of land use changes on soil microbial activity and community composition by comparing small, undisturbed family cemetery soils with adjacent agricultural fields and suburban lawns in Wicomico County, Maryland. Soil samples were collected monthly over a year from seven sites. The findings indicate that microbial enzymatic activities, specifically measured by fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis and dehydrogenase activity, were significantly higher in cemetery soils in a majority of cases. Seasonal variations were noted, with FDA activity peaking in spring, while dehydrogenase activity showed no seasonal change. Although dominant bacterial phyla were similar across soil types, Gemmatimonadetes was more abundant in field soils. Furthermore, 14 genera displayed differing relative abundances, correlating with soil chemical properties such as pH, organic matter, and phosphorus levels. Despite these differences in activity and composition, there was no significant difference in microbial richness or diversity between the two soil types. Overall, the study provides evidence that land use changes have significantly altered the biological properties of the soils examined."
