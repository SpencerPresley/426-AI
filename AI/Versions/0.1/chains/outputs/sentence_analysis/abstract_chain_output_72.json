    "detailed_summary": "This research explores the potential of eugenol derivatives in managing red imported fire ants, particularly in situations where synthetic insecticides are unsuitable. Building on previous findings that eugenol prevents food transport in fire ants for over 24 hours, the study evaluates five derivatives for their electrophysiological effects, toxicity, and repellency. Results indicate that all derivatives, except isoeugenyl acetate, effectively repel fire ants and exhibit concentration-dependent toxicity. Methyl isoeugenol stands out for its exceptional ability to repel defending ants and suppress digging behavior. The study also notes a significant reduction in nesting behaviors and a long-lasting effect of methyl isoeugenol in treated environments. Overall, the findings suggest promising avenues for developing effective and durable fire ant repellents."
