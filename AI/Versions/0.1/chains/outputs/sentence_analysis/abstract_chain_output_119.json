    "detailed_summary": "This research paper examines the return and reunion rates of Eastern Bluebirds (Sialia sialis), a partially migratory and socially monogamous species, in the context of low mate fidelity commonly observed in migratory birds. The authors monitored 59 pairs of Eastern Bluebirds over four breeding seasons to investigate how variations in migration affect breeding systems and mate choice. They also explored the relationship between nest success and mate fidelity. The findings indicate that Eastern Bluebirds exhibit high return and reunion rates, with many birds returning to their previous mates and nesting sites. This contrasts with prior studies and underscores the importance of replication in ecological and ornithological research."
