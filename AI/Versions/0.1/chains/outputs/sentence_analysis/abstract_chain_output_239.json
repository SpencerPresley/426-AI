    "detailed_summary": "The study investigates the effects of diabetes mellitus-induced hyperglycemia on peripheral nerves, specifically focusing on diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which affects a significant portion of diabetes patients. By leveraging zebrafish as an animal model, known for their utility in metabolic disorder research, the study extends previous findings that demonstrated the occurrence of diabetic complications in zebrafish. The researchers employed a novel approach by utilizing the transdermal absorption capabilities of zebrafish larvae to maintain hyperglycemia over a five-day period using a high concentration of D-glucose. The results revealed significant structural changes in the peripheral nerves, including motor axon defasciculation, impaired glial sheath formation, reduced myelination, and mislocation of sensory neurons. This research not only enhances the understanding of how hyperglycemia affects nerve structure but also positions zebrafish as a promising model for future investigations into DPN and potential drug discovery efforts aimed at addressing this diabetic complication."
