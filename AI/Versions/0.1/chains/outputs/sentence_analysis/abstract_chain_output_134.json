    "detailed_summary": "The study explores the impact of humor styles on the well-being of parents of children with developmental disabilities, who experience higher stress and poorer health than parents of typically developing children. It aims to identify the relationships between adaptive and maladaptive humor styles and various health outcomes, considering social support and positive reappraisal as mediating factors. The research involved 80 parents, with follow-up data collected from 40 participants four months later. Findings indicate that adaptive humor styles, specifically self-enhancing and affiliative humor, are linked to better mental health, mediated by social support. Conversely, self-defeating humor correlates with negative health outcomes, also mediated by social support. The study concludes that adaptive humor can enhance caregivers' resilience by fostering support and reframing stressors."
