The authors highlight the distribution's attractive properties related to tractability and interpretability. They apply this distribution to analyze Maryland population data from the 2010 U.S. Census, finding that it provides a superior fit compared to the traditional beta-binomial distribution. This new distribution not only addresses the issue of overdispersion but also aids in revealing underlying latent subgroups within the data, thereby offering new avenues for modeling and analysis in various fields."
