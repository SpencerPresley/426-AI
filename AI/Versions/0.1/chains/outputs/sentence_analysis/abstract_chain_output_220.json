    "detailed_summary": "This study examines the predation rates and locomotor behavior of juvenile summer flounder (Paralichthys dentatus) and southern flounder (P. lethostigma) in turbid salt marsh estuaries. The researchers tested predation rates under different daytime light and turbidity levels, finding that both species fed well on mysid shrimp and spionid polychaetes during the day, but predation on mysids declined in darkness. Interestingly, polychaete consumption remained stable in the dark, indicating effective non-visual foraging. Turbidity levels did not significantly affect predation rates for either prey type. The study also revealed that P. lethostigma was more active in lower turbidity but reduced swimming in higher turbidity, while both species employed a benthic ambush strategy under high turbidity. The research highlights a pronounced shift in foraging style for P. lethostigma as turbidity increases. With rising estuarine turbidity linked to climate change, the study emphasizes how these conditions can negatively impact feeding behaviors, particularly on visually dependent prey like mysids, ultimately affecting nursery habitat quality and the prey base for juvenile flounders."
