    "summary": "This study examines the qualitative comments from student evaluations in a community health nursing course over four semesters, finding that the feedback is notably consistent and predominantly negative. Students express a strong reliance on the textbook and view the course mainly as preparation for the NCLEX, while instructor attempts to promote critical analysis are met with confusion and resistance. The comments are analyzed through three discourse levels, uncovering issues that differ from conventional interpretations of evaluations. The research suggests that conflicting expectations between students and teachers may diminish the effectiveness of formal evaluations. Additionally, it raises concerns about the current nursing pedagogy practices, particularly the focus on standardized testing and structured teaching methods, linking these to broader neoliberal trends."
