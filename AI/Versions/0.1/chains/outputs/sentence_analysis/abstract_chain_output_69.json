    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the interconnections between self-regulated learning microanalysis, metacognitive monitoring, and self-regulated learning questionnaires in the context of reading. The findings reveal that participants' reported use of strategies aligns significantly with their questionnaire scores, indicating a strong relationship between these self-reported measures. Additionally, self-monitoring through microanalysis correlates with metacognitive monitoring and confidence judgments, suggesting that awareness of one's strategies impacts confidence in performance. The results also show that participants who recognize the strategies they employ tend to achieve better reading comprehension. Furthermore, both strategic planning and the actual use of strategies during reading are predictors of comprehension outcomes. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these findings and suggests future research avenues in the field of self-regulated learning microanalysis."
