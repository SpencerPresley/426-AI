    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the local impacts of a Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) program on poverty rates in rural Costa Rica from 2007 to 2009. Through the use of household surveys and geographic data, the authors controlled for various socioeconomic and geographic factors. The findings indicate that, while the PES payments did not have a significant effect on national poverty rates, there was an increase in poverty in areas where the program notably reduced deforestation. This increase in poverty was particularly pronounced among uneducated males working in agriculture. The study concludes that the trade-off between ecosystem service provision and poverty is not a universal phenomenon; where it does occur, targeted interventions for the most affected groups could help mitigate these adverse effects."
