To address this issue, the researchers developed a toolkit comprising web-based learning modules and simulation experiences with standardized patients aimed at improving advocacy skills among baccalaureate nursing students. Feedback from students was used to refine the toolkit, ensuring its effectiveness. Over four semesters, 131 students participated in the study, with a high percentage reporting that the toolkit significantly enhanced their understanding of advocacy, critical thinking, and practical application of advocacy skills. The conclusion emphasizes that such educational experiences are essential for developing advocacy skills in a safe learning environment, ultimately bridging the gap between theoretical expectations and practical application in nursing."
