To combat this, QSRs have been innovating with menus, personalized experiences, and new ordering methods to boost sales. However, the paper identifies a less common approach\u2014managing social media resources, specifically electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM)\u2014as a potential competitive advantage. The study examines the impact of geolocated social media messages that mention products and brands on customer engagement, using data from various digital sources. It finds that indirect social media interactions (likes, retweets, replies) significantly affect local competitor visits within a month, with this effect varying depending on competitor density. Ultimately, the research provides insights into how QSRs can effectively utilize social media to strengthen their positions in local markets."
