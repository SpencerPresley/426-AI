    "detailed_summary": "This research paper explores the under-studied area of customer courtesy and its impact on service employees. It highlights that while negative customer interactions are frequently discussed, the positive influence of customer courtesy has received less attention. The authors utilize social cognitive theory to suggest that customer courtesy can enhance service performance by boosting employee self-efficacy. They acknowledge that while organizations cannot directly control customer behavior, they can create a supportive environment that maximizes the benefits of positive customer interactions. The researchers developed a customer courtesy scale and conducted studies in the United States and East Asia to test their hypotheses. Their findings indicate that customer courtesy positively affects employee self-efficacy and service performance, with a stronger effect observed in supportive organizational climates. The paper concludes by emphasizing the importance of fostering positive workplace interactions for enhancing employee outcomes, despite the notion that negative experiences may have a more substantial impact."
