    "overall_theme": "The research focuses on the interactions between non-human primates and mangrove forests, highlighting the creation of a database to better understand these relationships and their implications for conservation.",
    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses the critical need for detailed information on the interactions between wildlife species and their habitats, specifically focusing on non-human primates and mangrove forests. Despite the recognized importance of mangrove forests for these primates, there is a significant gap in understanding their relationship. To address this, the researchers developed the MangPrim-21 database, which maps and measures interactions globally. The findings indicate that a substantial proportion of non-primates utilize mangrove forests, and many mangrove areas overlap with the habitats of non-human primates. Key countries such as Indonesia, Madagascar, Brazil, Cameroon, and Malaysia show the highest levels of interaction, with specific locations in Kalimantan identified as critical. The database serves as a valuable tool for conservation efforts, with implications for the protection of both non-human primates and mangrove forests. The research also questions existing assumptions about the role of mangrove forests as mere refuges for these primates, suggesting a more complex relationship that warrants further investigation."
