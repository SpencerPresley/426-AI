    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the role of resilience in reducing student departure from the accounting major by evaluating its influence as a coping strategy. Data were collected from 443 accounting majors across four U.S. universities using various psychometric tools. The analysis focused on the relationships between role stressors, psychological health, burnout, and departure intentions, while also assessing the positive effects of individual resilience levels. The findings revealed that role stressors negatively impacted psychological health and positively correlated with burnout and departure intentions. Resilience was found to counteract these negative associations by enhancing psychological health and reducing burnout, ultimately leading to a decrease in departure intentions. Thus, the study highlights the importance of resilience in promoting student retention in accounting programs."
