    "detailed_summary": "This study focuses on the creosote bush (Larrea tridentata), a significant shrub in North America's warm deserts, and examines its genetic complexity as an autopolyploid. The researchers determined the ploidy levels of ancient creosote leaves found in packrat middens in the Peloncillo Mountains of Arizona to trace the historical distribution of diploid and tetraploid races. Additionally, they measured the ploidy levels of modern creosote plants across several sites along the Arizona-New Mexico border to enhance their data collection. The findings reveal that modern creosote plants are predominantly diploid, with tetraploids found only in the northernmost sites. All ancient creosote from the middens were diploid, and modern plants at the Peloncillo site also exhibited diploidy but had larger guard cell areas, potentially as an adaptation to hotter and drier conditions. The absence of tetraploids in ancient fossils suggests that their arrival in eastern regions may have occurred recently, paralleling the late introduction of other Sonoran Desert plants."
