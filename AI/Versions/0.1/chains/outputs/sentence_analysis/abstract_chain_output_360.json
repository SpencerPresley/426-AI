    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses the diverse particle-use behaviors of eusocial insects, specifically focusing on red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta). It references a prior study that found these ants would deposit soil on surfaces treated with a repellent. The researchers hypothesized that the ants modify inaccessible surfaces by covering them with soil particles to aid in food search and transportation. They conducted laboratory experiments to observe this behavior on viscose surfaces and those treated with essential balm or liquid paraffin, in the presence of food or non-food items. The results showed that ants deposited more soil on treated surfaces compared to untreated ones, and that food presence significantly influenced particle relocation behavior. Additionally, this behavior was confirmed in field observations, illustrating its ecological relevance. The study found that ants needed sufficient soil coverage to effectively search for and transport food on viscose surfaces, and that their particle relocation efforts were limited by the distance they had to travel. Overall, this research provides new insights into the adaptive foraging strategies of fire ants through their use of particles."
