In total, 14 students participated, including five African American, four Latinx, four Asian American, and one Biracial student, with a gender distribution of nine women and five men. The study identified 20 critical incidents and six dominant themes, including issues of power differentials, personal devaluation, projection of racial stereotypes, and institutional devaluation of diversity. A notable finding was that instructors were the primary perpetrators of racism, contrasting with previous studies that suggested otherwise. The research also considered the types and severity of racism encountered. The authors discussed the implications for social justice education, providing recommendations for instructors and academic institutions to address these issues effectively."
