    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the factors influencing consumers' judgments of price fairness, particularly focusing on the role of social comparisons in the context of today's digital marketplace. It highlights a significant gap in existing studies that have not adequately considered how the purchase efforts of other consumers affect individual price fairness evaluations. Additionally, it notes a lack of empirical research on the cognitive and emotional processes that contribute to these judgments. To fill these gaps, the authors present two studies that explore how the efforts of referent consumers can help mitigate perceptions of unfair pricing when prices differ for the same product. The findings support a dual-process model, demonstrating that such efforts can reduce buyer anger and enhance understanding of price disparities, ultimately leading to a decrease in perceived price unfairness."
