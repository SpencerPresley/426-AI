    "detailed_summary": "This research paper explores the influence of R&D investment on firm performance, acknowledging that this relationship is affected by various internal factors. It identifies a gap in the existing literature regarding the dynamics of this effect. Utilizing the knowledge-based view and theory of intellectual capital, the authors develop a theoretical model to examine the interconnections between R&D investment, intellectual capital, organizational learning, and firm performance. They analyze seven years of panel data from two data centers, employing mediation and moderation models for their investigation. The findings reveal that intellectual capital fully mediates the relationship between R&D investment and firm performance, while organizational learning moderates the relationship between R&D investment and human capital. Ultimately, the study underscores the critical roles of intellectual capital and organizational learning in enhancing the effectiveness of R&D investment."
