    "detailed_summary": "This study analyzes the trends and patterns of opioid and non-opioid pharmacotherapy among privately insured pediatric cancer patients in the U.S. from 2005 to 2019. It identifies patients under 21 with specific cancer diagnoses and examines the proportion of those who received prescriptions for opioids, anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, antidepressants, and muscle relaxants during treatment. The methodology includes multivariable logistic regressions to assess changes over time. Findings indicate that 71% of the 4174 patients had opioid prescriptions, while smaller percentages received other medications. The results show a nonlinear trend in opioid use, with a peak in 2012 followed by a decline by 2018, contrasting with a significant linear increase in the use of non-opioid medications. The study concludes that there is a notable shift away from opioids towards non-opioid pharmacotherapy for pain management in this patient population."
