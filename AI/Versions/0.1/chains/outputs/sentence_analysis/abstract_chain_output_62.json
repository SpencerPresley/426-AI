The authors introduce a formal definition of EFT convergence and propose a Bayesian model to quantify these errors for correlated predictions. Central to their method are Gaussian processes, which facilitate efficient assessments of credible intervals and allow for the inclusion of correlated theory errors in EFT fits. They demonstrate the efficacy of their approach through model-checking diagnostics applied to nucleon-nucleon scattering data in chiral EFT. The paper includes detailed statistical derivations in the appendices and provides a Python software package named gsum, available for public use on GitHub, to implement their methods."
