By analyzing longitudinal data from Maryland school districts between the 2013-2016 school years, the research examines how district leadership adapted their codes of conduct following state guideline revisions. Utilizing a pre-post analytic design, the study assesses changes in the types and tiers of infractions and responses, comparing district codes with state recommendations. The findings reveal that districts generally increased the variety of response options available, particularly for serious infractions, although they also retained some punitive measures like in-school suspension. Overall, the research highlights the complexities of implementing discipline reforms and their implications for school leadership."
