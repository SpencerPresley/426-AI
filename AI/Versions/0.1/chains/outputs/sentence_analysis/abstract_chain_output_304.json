    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the attempts made to validate the principles of physiocracy in the context of eighteenth-century Baden. It emphasizes the concept of net yield as a key element of physiocratic thought, linking agricultural surplus to broader themes of material prosperity and moral welfare. Despite being positioned as self-evident, physiocracy faced significant criticism from detractors who questioned its theoretical validity. The trials to demonstrate these principles, though ultimately deemed unsuccessful, were noteworthy for their experiential approach aimed at persuading skeptics. The paper concludes that, despite the perceived failures, these efforts illustrate the importance of experimental practices in shaping convictions during the eighteenth century, influencing areas beyond the natural sciences."
