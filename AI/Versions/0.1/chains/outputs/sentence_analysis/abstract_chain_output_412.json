    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses the persistent disparities faced by Black LGBTQ+ individuals due to systemic racialized homophobia and transphobia, which result in worse life outcomes compared to their Black cisgender and heterosexual counterparts, as well as White LGBTQ+ individuals. It emphasizes that community psychologists are well-equipped to address these disparities. The research utilizes a critical whiteness studies approach, analyzing qualitative data from 17 White LGBTQ+ individuals to explore how white supremacy operates within LGBTQ+ spaces. Findings reveal that while White LGBTQ+ individuals express a desire to create intersectional environments, they often lack the skills to effectively confront anti-Black racism, leading to actions that inadvertently reinforce white supremacy, despite their stated commitments to Black LGBTQ+ liberation. The authors conclude by providing recommendations for community psychologists, advocating for intersectional coalition-building, training in queer critical race theory, and raising awareness among White individuals in LGBTQ+ movements to dismantle white supremacist structures."
