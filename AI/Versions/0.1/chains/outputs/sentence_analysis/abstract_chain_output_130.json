    "detailed_summary": "This research explores the complexities of female mate selection in tungara frogs, specifically how multiple sensory modalities (acoustic and visual) interact in noisy environments. The study identifies that while females can prefer attractive calls in the presence of single-type noise, they struggle to make choices when faced with multimodal noise, such as that from conspecific calls combined with visual distractions. The findings highlight the significance of social context and the timing of signals in effective communication. Ultimately, the research concludes that multimodal signals can complicate the sensory landscape, potentially reducing the effectiveness of female decision-making during mate selection."
