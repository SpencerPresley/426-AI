An event study of 152 announcements related to mobile payments indicates an average increase in firm value of 1.03%, demonstrating the effectiveness of these technologies. The research further identifies specific characteristics that can enhance this value increase, particularly emphasizing the role of retailer promotion in encouraging customer adoption. It also finds that retailers targeting younger customers experience greater benefits from mobile payment adoption compared to those targeting older demographics. Additionally, the study reveals an early-mover advantage, which is most pronounced when accompanied by a national rollout strategy. However, for retailers that adopt mobile payments later, the type of rollout strategy (expansive versus limited) does not significantly impact outcomes."
