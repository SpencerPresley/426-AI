    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses the use of eye movement miscue analysis as a method to investigate the reading process by capturing eye fixations and oral reading miscues. It highlights a study involving two successful college readers who had doubts about their reading efficacy. Through data collected from eye tracking, miscue analysis, and retelling, the authors guided these readers to reflect on their beliefs about reading and their self-identification as readers. The study involved analyzing the readers' eye movements while they read two different texts: one informational and one constructed with errors. The findings are related to the readers' perceptions of their identities and reading processes. The research concludes with practical implications for teachers, suggesting strategies to help readers address misconceptions and empower them as meaning makers in their reading experiences."
