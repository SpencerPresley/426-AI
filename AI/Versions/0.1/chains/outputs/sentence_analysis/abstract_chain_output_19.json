    "overall_theme": "The research investigates the discrepancies in understanding probability vocabulary between students and mathematicians and proposes a framework for improving vocabulary instruction.",
    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses the necessity of shared meanings in normative discourse about probability, highlighting a gap between students' and mathematicians' interpretations of vocabulary. It notes inconsistencies in current educational standards regarding how to address this issue. The study employs microgenetic research to analyze the vocabulary usage of four students throughout a series of lessons designed to enhance their understanding of probability terms. By identifying both normative and nonnormative language uses, the research aims to inform the development of curricula and standards. It underscores the significance of several key concepts\u2014incrementality, multidimensionality, polysemy, interrelatedness, and heterogeneity\u2014as essential for fostering students' growth in probability vocabulary."
