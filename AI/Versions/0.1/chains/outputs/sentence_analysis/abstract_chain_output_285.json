    "detailed_summary": "This pilot study aimed to evaluate the hypothesis that acute lower leg heating (LLH) can improve postheating popliteal artery blood flow and walking distance in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Six patients participated in three randomized treatment sessions, which included control and bilateral LLH treatments conducted through water bath immersion at 42 degrees Celsius for either 15 or 45 minutes. Measurements of popliteal artery blood flow and arterial pressure were taken before and after the heating sessions, while 6-minute walk distances were assessed on both control and experimental days, specifically 35 minutes after LLH. The results indicated a significant increase in popliteal artery blood flow in a duration-dependent manner following heating, with statistical significance noted for both treatment durations. Additionally, walking distances improved by 10% and 12% after the 15-minute and 45-minute heating treatments, respectively. The study concluded that lower leg heating, even for short durations, effectively enhances blood perfusion and exercise capacity in patients with PAD."
