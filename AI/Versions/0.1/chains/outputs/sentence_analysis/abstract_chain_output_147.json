    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses the complexity of analysts' decision-making processes regarding target price revisions based on earnings and non-earnings forecasts. To address this, the authors developed a new metric called Internal Relevance (IR) using decision tree analysis, which quantifies the integration of consensus earnings and sales forecast revisions into target price changes. The study finds that stocks with higher IR experience more significant market reactions, including abnormal returns, trading volumes, and volatility, and confirms these results through various robustness checks. Additionally, the authors illustrate the practical utility of IR in portfolio analysis, suggesting that it can be effectively used to screen stocks to enhance trading profitability."
