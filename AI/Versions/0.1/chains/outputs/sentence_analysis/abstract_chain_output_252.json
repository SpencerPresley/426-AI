The study specifically investigates the availability of psychology of religion courses in undergraduate curricula and assesses the knowledge gained by students enrolled in these courses. The findings reveal that, unlike graduate programs, there has been no increase in the availability of these courses for undergraduates. However, students who took psychology of religion courses demonstrated a significant gain in scientific knowledge compared to those enrolled in other psychology courses. The study concludes by advocating for an increase in the number of psychology of religion courses offered to undergraduate students to enhance their educational experience."
