Despite their popularity in the retail sector, there is a notable lack of academic research on their effects on retailers. The study utilizes an event analysis of 185 announcements related to these agreements and finds that they typically increase firm value by an average of 1.06%, demonstrating their effectiveness. Further analysis reveals that specific characteristics of these agreements can enhance firm value, particularly when retailers partner with dissimilar retail partners that share a similar brand image. The findings also indicate that retailers leasing their space benefit from collaborating with reputable retailers, while those renting space gain value from partnerships with retailers that have a significant retail presence."
