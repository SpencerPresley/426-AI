It analyzes the IUCN Red List database, focusing on five major threats: overexploitation, climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, and invasive species. The findings reveal that 88.3% of the 20,784 assessed species are affected by habitat destruction, which is also identified as the dominant threat for 71.3% of species facing extinction risk. In contrast, climate change is found to be the least impactful threat. The results suggest that global conservation priorities need to shift towards addressing habitat destruction while ensuring that solutions to other environmental issues do not exacerbate this problem."
