    "detailed_summary": "This paper addresses the dual challenges faced by organizations in a globalized environment: developing actionable insights from large data volumes and managing supply chain risks. It aims to integrate these issues by investigating how firms can use big data analytics (BDA) capabilities to predict risks through an automated risk alert tool. The authors conducted a questionnaire-based survey supported by secondary data to gather insights from 213 senior and middle-level managers regarding the development of such a tool. Employing econometric techniques, they identified the necessary conditions for the effectiveness of the automated risk management tool. The findings indicate that organizations can enhance their risk management by focusing on a robust IT infrastructure and strong BDA capabilities. The study also revealed the moderating effects of upstream and downstream supply chain IT infrastructure on various BDA capabilities. Ultimately, the research concludes that the effectiveness of a risk alert tool is contingent upon how well firms utilize BDA capabilities. This study is significant as it empirically identifies specific BDA capabilities that can foster risk resilience in supply chains, contributing valuable insights to the literature on supply chain risk management."
