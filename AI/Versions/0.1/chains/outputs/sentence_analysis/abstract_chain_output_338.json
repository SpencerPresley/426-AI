The findings highlight the intersubjective nature of the provider-patient relationship, emphasizing that both parties engage in a shared, embodied interaction that shapes therapeutic goals. The study advocates for the inclusion of providers' self-reflexive awareness in patient-centered healthcare, suggesting that this approach can enhance the healthcare experience and outcomes for both patients and providers."
