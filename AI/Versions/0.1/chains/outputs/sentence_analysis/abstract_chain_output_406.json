    "detailed_summary": "This study explores the interaction between the black-winged subterranean termite, Odontotermes formosanus, a significant pest in China, and Trichoderma fungi. The termite cultivates symbiotic Termitomyces, which face threats from these fungi. Previous research indicated reduced tunneling activity in O. formosanus in the presence of Trichoderma viride. The authors hypothesized that Trichoderma fungi repel O. formosanus, leading to a series of choice tests to evaluate tunneling and aggregation behaviors in response to unformulated conidia of seven Trichoderma species. Additionally, they examined the colony-initiation preferences of paired adult termites in treated versus untreated soil. Results showed that most Trichoderma species decreased tunneling activity, except for T. harzianum, while some species repelled termites and others attracted them during aggregation tests. However, there was no significant impact on the reproductive behavior of the termites. The study concludes that Trichoderma fungi generally repel tunneling but have varied effects on aggregation preferences among O. formosanus workers."
