    "detailed_summary": "This chapter investigates how Marx's critique of political economy has been adapted within Marxist-oriented environmental sociology, focusing on treadmill of production (ToP) theory. It aims to clarify the theoretical tools available for a rigorous critique of environmental degradation caused by capitalism. The chapter identifies shortcomings in ToP theory regarding its understanding of capital and value, and elaborates on the reasons for these shortcomings by reconsidering key aspects of Marx's critical theory. It contributes to ongoing discussions in critical theory and environmental sociology by demonstrating the relevance of Marx's ideas for understanding the political-economic, social, and ideational aspects of planetary degradation. In contrast to ToP theory, which examines wealth production against resource limits, the chapter conceptualizes post-World War II environmental degradation as linked to a continuous necessity for value in capitalism. Finally, it discusses how Marxian critical theory enables an examination of the growth of environmentalism in relation to the rise of neoliberal capitalism."
