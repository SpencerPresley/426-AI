The authors use this situation as a case study to delve into the relationship between recycling practices and administrative constructs through deliberative policy analysis (DPA). They argue that the identity of 'the recycler' is shaped by administrative actions and concerns, which influence public understanding of recycling roles and practices. Furthermore, the authors differentiate between social and administrative constructions of identity, emphasizing how administrative definitions can restrict deliberative potential within recycling discussions. This highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of how administration impacts recycling efforts and public engagement."
