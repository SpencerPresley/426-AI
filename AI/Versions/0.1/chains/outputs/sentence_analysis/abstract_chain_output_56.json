    "detailed_summary": "This study explores the impact of diverse environmental conditions on the mating behaviors of male and female tungara frogs. The researchers manipulated the physical environment by altering substrate types (terrestrial and aquatic) and ambient light levels to observe phonotactic responses to multimodal (audiovisual) and unimodal (acoustic) stimuli. The findings reveal that female frogs maintained a preference for audiovisual signals regardless of substrate but exhibited faster decision-making in aquatic settings. Interestingly, increased ambient light altered female preferences, leading them to avoid multimodal signals, while latency remained unchanged. Male frogs showed no preference for multimodal signals across environments, although their response speed improved in water. The study emphasizes that different environments carry unique costs, particularly in terms of predation risk, which influences behavioral responses. The results challenge the notion of static mating preferences, suggesting that both innate preferences and environmental conditions significantly shape sexual selection dynamics."
