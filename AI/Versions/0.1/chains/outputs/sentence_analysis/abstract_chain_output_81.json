    "detailed_summary": "The study focuses on Ectropis grisescens, a significant pest of tea plants, and the challenges posed by synthetic pesticides, which can leave harmful residues. The researchers hypothesized that soil treatments with the biopesticides Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana would reduce the survivorship and fitness of E. grisescens. Experiments revealed that specific concentrations of these biopesticides could achieve 50% mortality in pupating larvae. Additionally, high concentrations significantly reduced the emergence success of the pests and exhibited repellent effects. However, lower concentrations did not impact the reproductive success or longevity of adult pests. The findings suggest that while the biopesticides can cause direct mortality, they may not effectively control pest populations at sublethal levels, indicating a need for further research on optimal application rates in the field."
