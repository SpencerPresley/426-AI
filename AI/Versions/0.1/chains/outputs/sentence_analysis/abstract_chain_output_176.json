    "detailed_summary": "This research paper explores the impact of advancing technology and consumer demand for contactless payments on retail practices. Despite the growing adoption of contactless payment methods, there is limited research on how consumers perceive these methods compared to traditional forms of payment like cash and credit cards. Through two experiments, the study finds that contactless payments are perceived as less contaminated than traditional payment methods, leading to more favorable attitudes toward retailers that offer these options. However, this positive perception may be diminished for retailers whose customers expect to use cash, which is viewed as a contaminated payment method. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of consumer perceptions in the adoption of payment technologies."
