    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the personal memories of nine women English teachers regarding their raced, classed, and gendered identities, framing teaching as an act of invasion. Utilizing collective memory work (CMW), a qualitative feminist research method, the researchers structured collaborative sessions where participants documented and analyzed their memories. The analysis of two specific memories highlighted how new materialism and a social understanding of emotions can enhance insights into teacher identities and challenge traditional narratives of education. Additionally, the concept of intra-action was used to explore the complexities of teacher-student relationships, emphasizing the entanglement of materials, emotions, and discourses in teaching. The findings suggest that collective methodologies like CMW can facilitate deeper explorations of teachers' identities and relationships, while examining everyday classroom interactions through the lens of literacy-as-event can reveal critical understandings of the intertwined nature of bodies, emotions, and objects in the teaching process."
