To overcome this, an innovative teaching strategy was implemented, involving a collaboration with the theater department. Theater students participated in an independent study where they were trained to act as standardized patients, engaging with senior nursing students in a psychiatric mental health nursing course. This approach has been successfully running for two years, with 10 theater students and 180 nursing students participating, resulting in observed improvements in the communication skills of the nursing students. The authors suggest that further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this pilot project for both nursing and theater students."
