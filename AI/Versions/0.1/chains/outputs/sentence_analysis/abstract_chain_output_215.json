    "detailed_summary": "This research paper examines how auditor industry specialization influences accounting quality within the EU, using a difference-in-differences methodology to analyze various auditor groups. It finds that the mandatory adoption of IFRS is associated with improved accounting quality among both non-industry specialists and EUC-level industry specialists. Furthermore, EUM-level industry specialists demonstrate superior accounting quality compared to non-specialists across both pre- and post-IFRS periods. The study acknowledges limitations related to the use of proxy measures for industry specialization and accounting quality, and emphasizes that its findings are specifically applicable to mandatory IFRS adopters in the EU. The implications of this research are significant for regulators, highlighting the importance of industry-specialized auditors in ensuring high-quality financial reporting, and suggesting that these findings may have relevance beyond the EU context. This study is one of the first to explore the impact of auditor specialization on accounting quality in the EU, particularly in relation to IFRS adoption."
