It introduces Conjecture O, which posits that Property O is applicable to all Fano varieties. The work references Pasquier's classification of smooth nonhomogeneous horospherical varieties of Picard rank 1 into five classes, noting that Conjecture O has been confirmed for the odd symplectic Grassmannians, one of these classes. The authors aim to extend the applicability of Conjecture O by proving it for two additional classes and providing an example from a third class in Pasquier's classification. They employ Perron-Frobenius theory to facilitate a graph-theoretic approach to their proofs, indicating a novel method in their research."
