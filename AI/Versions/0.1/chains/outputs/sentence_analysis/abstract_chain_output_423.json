    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates how a company's orientation towards its stakeholders affects its strategies for tax avoidance. By analyzing the staggered implementation of constituency statutes across various U.S. states from 1983 to 2006, the authors find that a greater emphasis on stakeholder interests correlates with increased tax avoidance. Additionally, the study identifies that firms with limited financial resources tend to engage in higher levels of tax avoidance, which can benefit employees. These findings support stakeholder salience theory, suggesting that managers with constrained resources prioritize the needs of more significant stakeholders, like employees, over those of secondary stakeholders, such as the government."
