            "sentence": "Drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijani migrants, I propose the notion of chronotopization to understand how perceptions of normative social behavior are dynamically constructed and organized with respect to time, space, and the people involved in the interaction.",
            "meaning": "The author uses data from Iranian Azerbaijani migrants to introduce the concept of chronotopization, which helps explain how social behavior norms are shaped by time, space, and interpersonal dynamics.",
            "reasoning": "The sentence indicates that the research is based on empirical data and introduces a theoretical framework (chronotopization) for analyzing social behavior.",

            "sentence": "The differently scaled chronotopes of normalcy (re-)constructed and enregistered in these processes, I argue, guide social actors' sociolinguistic behaviors and normative judgments.",
            "meaning": "The author claims that various levels of constructed norms (chronotopes) influence how individuals behave linguistically and make judgments about what is considered normal.",
            "reasoning": "This sentence elaborates on the previous concept by explaining how these constructed norms affect social interactions and linguistic choices.",

            "sentence": "Through an analysis of participants' metacommentaries on appropriate language choice, I discuss how chronotopic and scalar understandings of normalcy can offer us a broader theory of language use and can be applied to a wide array of sociolinguistic phenomena beyond language choice.",
            "meaning": "The author analyzes participants' reflections on language use to illustrate that the concepts of chronotopes and normalcy can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of language use in various sociolinguistic contexts.",
            "reasoning": "This sentence indicates a methodological approach (analyzing metacommentaries) and suggests the broader applicability of the findings to other sociolinguistic issues.",

    ],
    "overall_theme": "The research explores how perceptions of social norms and language use among Iranian Azerbaijani migrants are shaped by the interplay of time, space, and social interactions through the lens of chronotopization.",
    "detailed_summary": "The abstract presents a study that utilizes data from Iranian Azerbaijani migrants to introduce the concept of chronotopization, which helps in understanding the dynamic construction of normative social behaviors influenced by temporal and spatial contexts. The author argues that different levels of constructed norms, termed chronotopes, play a significant role in guiding individuals' sociolinguistic behaviors and their judgments about what is considered normal. Through an analysis of participants' reflections on their language choices, the research highlights that these chronotopic frameworks can enhance our understanding of language use and can be extended to various sociolinguistic phenomena beyond mere language choice. Overall, the study contributes to the field of sociolinguistics by offering a novel theoretical perspective on the interaction between language and social norms."
