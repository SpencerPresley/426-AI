    "detailed_summary": "This research article reflects on the Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education's (JSDSE) initiatives aimed at expanding its readership and influence, particularly in the K-12 education sector. The authors analyze JSDSE's impact by emphasizing its role in fostering statistical knowledge for teaching (SKT) and introduce a new concept, statistical knowledge for the transformation of teaching (SKT2), to better articulate JSDSE's contributions. The analysis is informed by the perspectives of an experienced high school teacher and a statistics education researcher, who collaboratively explore recent JSDSE publications to identify insights relevant to teaching practice. They propose strategies for JSDSE to enhance its contributions to SKT and SKT2, ultimately aiming to bridge the gap between formal research and practical application in K-12 education."
