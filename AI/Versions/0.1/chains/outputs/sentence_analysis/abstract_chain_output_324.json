    "detailed_summary": "This study constructs a relationship between the far to extreme ultraviolet (UV) colors of over 480,000 quasars and their redshifts, using data from SDSS Data Release 14 and the GALEX photometric catalogue. It provides UV matching and detection probabilities, taking into account factors such as separation, optical brightness, and redshift, along with detection limits for each quasar. The findings indicate that UV color distributions are generally skewed redward across most redshifts, especially when detection limits are considered. A reliable median color-redshift relation has been established up to a redshift of approximately 2.8, with extreme UV colors found to be significantly redder than previously reported values. The study employs forward modeling of quasar spectra through GALEX filters, considering intergalactic opacity and intrinsic reddening. It concludes that intergalactic absorption alone cannot explain the observed red EUV colors. The research suggests no intrinsic reddening for the color-redshift relationship, particularly for SMC-like extinction. Notably, the best-fit model shows a FUV power-law slope consistent with previous studies, but a much redder EUV slope that diverges from past composite values. This discrepancy may stem from previous studies' selection bias towards brighter and bluer objects. The weak EUV flux observed implies that quasar accretion disc models should incorporate outflows like disc winds."
