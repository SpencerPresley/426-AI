    "detailed_summary": "This study addresses the critical issue of retention rates among direct care workers (DCWs) in China's aged care industry, highlighting its impact on care quality. The research identifies a significant gap in existing literature regarding the factors affecting retention. Utilizing a cross-sectional survey design, the study surveyed 370 DCWs from hospitals and 311 from long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in Fujian Province. Key measures included turnover intention, contractual status, income, and sociodemographic factors, all self-reported by participants. The results revealed that a higher proportion of hospital DCWs had employment contracts compared to those in LTCFs, and hospital workers reported significantly lower turnover intentions. Contracted DCWs in hospitals demonstrated the lowest turnover intention rates. In contrast, both contracted and noncontracted DCWs in LTCFs exhibited higher turnover intentions. The study concludes that both contractual status and facility type are crucial in determining turnover intention, suggesting that increased use of employment contracts could enhance job stability and reduce turnover rates. Furthermore, it advocates for regulatory measures in the labor market for DCWs under Chinese Labor Law to improve working conditions and retention."
