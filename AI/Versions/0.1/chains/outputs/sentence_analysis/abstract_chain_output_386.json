    "detailed_summary": "This research paper emphasizes the significant role that social work can play in the human rights debate due to its core values of social justice and respect for individuals. It notes that while many international scholars view social work as a human rights profession, its visibility in this area has been limited. Given the current global and domestic challenges, the authors stress the importance of equipping social work students with human rights knowledge. The paper reviews existing literature on the topic within U.S. social work education and identifies three key areas: general integration of human rights, pedagogical frameworks for teaching these concepts, and assessment measures for their incorporation. The findings reveal that the integration of human rights into social work education is still in its early stages, leading to the recommendation that programs should be more deliberate in including human rights content to prepare culturally competent and globally minded professionals."
