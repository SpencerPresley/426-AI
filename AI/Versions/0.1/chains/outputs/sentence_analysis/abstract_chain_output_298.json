    "detailed_summary": "This study explores the relationship between empathy and experiences of sexual aggression, specifically examining how individuals empathize with hypothetical rape victims and rapists based on their own victimization and perpetration experiences, as well as their gender. A sample of 531 undergraduate students completed relevant empathy scales and surveys on sexual experiences, leading to the categorization of participants into four groups: nonexperienced, victimization-only, perpetration-only, and overlapping experience. The findings reveal that those with victimization-only experience exhibit significantly greater empathy towards rape victims compared to those with overlapping or no experiences, while empathy towards rapists did not differ among these groups. Gender differences were also noted, with women showing higher empathy for victims and lower for perpetrators than men. The study suggests that individuals with overlapping experiences may struggle to empathize with rape victims to the same degree as those with victimization-only experience. It concludes by recommending that future research should differentiate between overlapping experiences and the other categories to better understand empathy dynamics."
