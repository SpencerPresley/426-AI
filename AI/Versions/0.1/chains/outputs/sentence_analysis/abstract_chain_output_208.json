            "sentence": "Utilizing evidence from literary stylistics, and in keeping with the Kachruvian tradition, this paper makes the case for WE scholars to remain vigilant of the move away from the revolutionary heteroglossia and de-Englishing strategies hallmarking literary creation and analyses of postcolonial writings from the margin - so apparent in Braj B. Kachru's works - to a current era of monoglossic inspired re-Englishing strategies underpinning the post-globalist enterprise of so-called 'flat-world' fiction in which under the guise of linguistic deterritorialization, center and periphery stratificational and spatialized arrangements emerge somewhat mitigated - even obfuscated.",
            "meaning": "The paper argues that World English (WE) scholars should be cautious about the shift from diverse language practices in postcolonial literature to a more uniform approach influenced by globalized fiction, which obscures important linguistic hierarchies.",

    "overall_theme": "The paper emphasizes the need for World English scholars to recognize and critically engage with the shifts in linguistic practices in postcolonial literature, particularly in light of Kachru's theories, amidst contemporary analytical trends.",
    "detailed_summary": "This research paper discusses the evolution of linguistic strategies in postcolonial literature, emphasizing the transition from diverse, heteroglossic practices to more uniform, monoglossic approaches influenced by globalized fiction. The author draws on Braj B. Kachru's work to highlight the significance of linguistic asymmetries that persist despite the current focus on context and spatiality in literary analysis. Through evidence from contemporary frameworks in sociolinguistics, pedagogical linguistics, and political economy, the paper argues for the ongoing relevance of Kachru's theories in understanding the complexities of language use in a globalized world. The overall aim is to encourage vigilance among WE scholars regarding these shifts and their implications for postcolonial discourse."
