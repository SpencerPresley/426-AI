Interestingly, perceived ease of use does not directly influence adoption but is mediated by enjoyment and usefulness. The findings suggest that as users become more accustomed to smart speakers, their sensitivity to privacy risks increases. However, in South Korea, perceived usefulness can help alleviate the negative impact of privacy concerns on adoption intentions, indicating cultural differences in user perceptions."
