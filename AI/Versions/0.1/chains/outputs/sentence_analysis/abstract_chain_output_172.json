    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the quantum cohomology of the (2n-1)-dimensional quadric OG, specifically at q = 1. The authors aim to calculate the characteristic polynomial associated with the linear operators that arise from quantum multiplication in this cohomology space, as well as determine the Frobenius-Perron dimension, which relates to the behavior of these operators. Additionally, they will examine whether Galkin's lower bound conjecture is valid for the quadric OG, contributing to the understanding of the mathematical properties of this geometric object."
