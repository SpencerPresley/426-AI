    "detailed_summary": "The research paper abstract outlines the efforts of universities to increase faculty diversity in response to societal demands. Despite various small-scale programs, progress has been limited, prompting the authors to propose a consortia approach that connects individuals to hiring opportunities within a state university system. They present a case study of the NSF-funded AGEP PROMISE Academy in the University System of Maryland, which aims to diversify faculty across multiple institution types. Key components of the initiative include improved recruitment practices, multi-institutional networking, and support for transitioning postdocs into tenure-track roles. This model is innovative as it focuses on creating pathways to permanent positions rather than merely enhancing individual qualifications. The program's decentralized financial structure allows for broader replication. The authors emphasize the urgent need for collaborative strategies and the lessons learned from their evaluations. Ultimately, the AGEP PROMISE Academy serves as a potential model for other university systems seeking to diversify their faculty."
