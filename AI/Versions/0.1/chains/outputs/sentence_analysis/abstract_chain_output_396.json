    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses a study that investigates how firms can improve their Risk Management Infrastructure (RMI) by leveraging Big Data Analytics (BDA) to enhance their capability to withstand risks. A theoretical model was created to guide the research, and the hypothesis was tested using surveys and quantitative analysis. The results indicate that the adoption of BDA significantly enhances the effectiveness of RMI by positively influencing risk resilience, suggesting that firms can benefit from integrating BDA into their risk management strategies."
