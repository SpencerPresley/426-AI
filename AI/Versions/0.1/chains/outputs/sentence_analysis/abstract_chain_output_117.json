    "detailed_summary": "The research paper addresses the growing concern among trauma scholars regarding the vulnerability of mental health providers to secondary trauma. It specifically examines the relationship between social work practice with trauma-exposed clients and the incidence of secondary traumatic stress among social workers. The study aims to identify various contributing factors to the development of secondary trauma, also referred to as compassion fatigue. A simple random sample of members from the National Association of Social Workers participated in an online survey that assessed their exposure to secondary traumatic stress and their coping responses. The survey utilized standardized measures, including the Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale and The Coping Strategies Inventory, to evaluate secondary trauma and self-care strategies. Additionally, a non-standardized measure assessed the magnitude of social workers' clinical workloads with trauma clients, while job satisfaction was measured using items from an existing workplace questionnaire. A total of 161 social workers completed the survey, which took approximately 35 minutes. The findings revealed that higher levels of engagement in high-magnitude social work practice are associated with increased secondary trauma, while self-care strategies were shown to help mitigate these effects. The study concludes with a discussion on the educational and workforce implications of these findings."
