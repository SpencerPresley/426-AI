    "overall_theme": "The abstract explores how beliefs about undocumented immigrants as either harmful agents or victims influence support for different types of immigration policies, using the Theory of Dyadic Morality as a framework.",
    "detailed_summary": "This research investigates the impact of beliefs about undocumented immigrants on support for punitive versus helping policies. It proposes that viewing immigrants as harmful agents is linked to support for punitive policies, mediated by emotions like disgust and anger, while perceiving them as victims is associated with support for helping policies, mediated by empathy-related emotions. Two studies were conducted: Study 1 involved qualitative responses that were analyzed for themes, revealing a connection between agent beliefs and punitive support, while Study 2 confirmed these findings and added the victim perspective. The research highlights the relevance of these findings to ongoing policy debates regarding undocumented immigrants."
