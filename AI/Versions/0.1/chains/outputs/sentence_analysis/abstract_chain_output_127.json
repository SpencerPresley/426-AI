    "detailed_summary": "This study aims to explore the stereotype contents among Vietnamese high school and college students and to assess the predictive capabilities of three theoretical models within a communication framework. Utilizing a purposive sample of 291 students, the findings reveal that the participants generally hold positive stereotypes about Americans, while their views on Black/African-Americans are mixed, encompassing both positive and negative aspects. Among the three theoretical models evaluated, the communication model emerged as the most effective predictor, followed by the psychological model, with the contact model being the least effective. The study concludes by discussing the theoretical and practical implications of these findings, suggesting that the results may inform both academic understanding and real-world applications."
