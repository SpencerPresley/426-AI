Through a case study of a 53-year-old woman experiencing exercise-induced headaches with aura, the paper illustrates the clinical presentation of atrial myxomas. The patient found relief from her headaches with Ibuprofen but also experienced photophobia and nausea. A clinical discussion identifies a typical triad of symptoms associated with the condition, including obstructive, embolic, and constitutional symptoms, with cerebral infarction being a frequent complication. The patient had multiple acute and sub-acute embolic infarcts, but her symptoms resolved after surgical resection of the myxoma. The conclusion stresses that atrial myxomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with migraines accompanied by aura, especially those with exercise-induced headaches, indicating a need for further clinical investigation."
