    "detailed_summary": "This study explores how individual resilience can counteract the negative impacts of role stressors, stress arousal, and burnout on job satisfaction and turnover intentions among auditors. Conducted with a sample of 332 auditors from nine public accounting firms, the research employs structural equations modeling to analyze an expanded role stress model. The findings indicate that resilience is directly associated with lower levels of stress and burnout, while also indirectly enhancing job satisfaction and reducing turnover intentions. The study acknowledges limitations due to its cross-sectional design and reliance on self-report data, which prevent definitive causal conclusions. Nonetheless, it contributes to the understanding of resilience as a coping mechanism in auditor work settings. The implications suggest that resilience training programs could be valuable in reducing burnout, thereby improving job satisfaction and lowering turnover intentions among public accounting staff."
