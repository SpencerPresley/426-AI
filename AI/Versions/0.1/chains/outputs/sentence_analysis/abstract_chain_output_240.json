    "detailed_summary": "This research paper analyzes how contraband slaves were represented in Harper's Weekly and Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper during the Civil War. It discusses how these publications competed for readership by asserting the authenticity of their images and reports. Initially, illustrations relied on long-established racial stereotypes, reflecting societal biases. The study contextualizes these representations with references to blackface minstrelsy and scientific racism, which shaped public perception. The research concludes that the portrayal of African Americans underwent significant transformation during the Civil War, particularly as emancipation progressed and more black individuals served in the Union military, indicating a shift in societal attitudes and media representation."
