            "reasoning": "The contrast between 'modeling' and 'replicating' suggests a deeper learning process, and the phrase 'counterintuitive idea' indicates a significant conceptual takeaway.",

    "detailed_summary": "The research paper explores the role of the board game Diplomacy in international relations courses, highlighting its benefits for student learning. The author poses a question about how the game aids in understanding both different IR theories and their practical application. Drawing from personal experiences overseeing the game in seven introductory classes and analyzing debriefing worksheets from 151 students, the author examines whether students made connections to theoretical perspectives and developed a critical understanding of theoretical abstraction. The findings suggest that the game's social and collaborative nature allows for the exploration of theories beyond neorealism. Additionally, the author emphasizes that Diplomacy models world politics in a way that reveals the complexities of theories, illustrating that while theories can provide insights, they also distort reality. Lastly, reflecting on the game's limitations fosters critical thinking, helping students prepare for future topics and recognize the challenges of applying theories in real-world contexts."
