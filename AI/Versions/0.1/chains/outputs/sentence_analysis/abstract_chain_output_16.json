    "detailed_summary": "This study examines the increasing trend of corporate lobbying for environmentally friendly policies, contrasting it with traditional lobbying aimed at reducing regulatory burdens. The authors explore the motivations behind this shift, particularly emphasizing the role of product strategy. They suggest that firms with a higher intensity of green products are more likely to engage in environmental lobbying. The research highlights that these firms can adapt to new environmental regulations more easily, putting less environmentally friendly firms at a disadvantage. Additionally, such firms can effectively lobby for government incentives and subsidies to promote green products. An analysis of the US light vehicle market reveals a positive correlation between the sales of electric vehicles and the level of environmental lobbying. This relationship is further amplified for firms with larger market shares or those from countries with stricter environmental regulations. Overall, the findings underscore the strategic importance of product focus in shaping lobbying behaviors in the context of environmental advocacy."
