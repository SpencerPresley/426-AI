    "detailed_summary": "This research focuses on understanding the three-nucleon force (3NF) within the framework of chiral effective field theory (xEFT) by examining bound-state observables in systems with three and four nucleons. The authors conduct a statistically rigorous analysis that accounts for various uncertainties, including experimental errors and computational method uncertainties, as well as the truncation errors associated with the xEFT model. They emphasize that a consistent solution for binding energies and decay rates can only be achieved when these truncation errors are included. Notably, the I3-decay rate provides unique constraints on the low-energy constants of the 3NF, highlighting its importance in parameter estimation. The researchers employ eigenvector continuation to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of their no-core shell model calculations, facilitating the sampling of posterior probability distributions. Ultimately, they report a value for the xEFT expansion parameter of Q = 0.33 +/- 0.06, which reflects their findings on the observables analyzed."
