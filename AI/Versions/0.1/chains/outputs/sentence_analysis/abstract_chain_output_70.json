It posits that humility can create a self-transcendent contagion effect, encouraging followers to engage in behaviors that benefit others. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding humility as a construct that influences how leader behaviors serve as contextual signals shaping followers' motivations. The findings indicate that leader humility is positively correlated with follower prosocial motivation, which is mediated by the followers' perception of the meaningfulness of their work. Additionally, this mediation is moderated by followers' perception of relational vitality, suggesting that the impact of leader humility varies based on how connected followers feel in their relationships. The study concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for leadership and organizational behavior."
