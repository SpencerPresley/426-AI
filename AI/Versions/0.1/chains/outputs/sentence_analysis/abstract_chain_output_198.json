    "detailed_summary": "This pilot study aimed to explore the short-term effects of vigorous physical activity on executive control among eighth grade students in the U.S. A total of 68 students (26 girls and 42 boys) from a middle school in the Mountain West participated. They were divided into two groups, with one group engaging in vigorous physical activity and the other remaining sedentary, following a counter-balanced cross-over design with a two-week washout period. After the interventions, participants completed the Trails Making Tests A and B to assess their executive control. Statistical analyses, specifically mixed design ANOVA tests, were employed to compare performance between the two groups and to examine any effects of sex. Results indicated that students who participated in the physical activity condition completed TMT-B significantly faster than those in the sedentary condition, with a mean difference of -6.5 seconds. However, no significant differences were observed on TMT-A, nor were there any interactions based on sex. The findings suggest that vigorous physical activity might enhance executive control in middle-school students, contributing to the growing body of literature linking physical activity and cognitive performance in educational settings."
