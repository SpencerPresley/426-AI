    "detailed_summary": "The research paper explores the concept of healthcare stereotype threat (HCST), which refers to the reduction of individuals to stereotypes based on their social identities during healthcare encounters, leading to stigma and discrimination. The study specifically investigates how older gay men living with HIV perceive their healthcare experiences in relation to their social identities. Utilizing HCST as a framework, the researchers conducted a content and structural coding analysis on interviews with 11 participants. The findings reveal that most HCST experiences were linked to the participants' sexual orientation, HIV status, and age. Key themes emerged around interactions with healthcare providers and their attitudes, indicating that these factors significantly influenced the participants' healthcare experiences. Ultimately, the study illustrates the connection between marginalized social identities and the healthcare experiences of older gay men living with HIV, highlighting the broader implications of these identities on their lifetime healthcare encounters."
