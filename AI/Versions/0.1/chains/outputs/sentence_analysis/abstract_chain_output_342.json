    "detailed_summary": "The abstract presents a study exploring how emotional intelligence (EI) affects service quality in the retail sector, particularly in a competitive market. It discusses the importance of hiring emotionally intelligent employees and training them in emotional competencies to enhance customer service. Through a meta-analysis, the research confirms that there is a significant positive relationship between EI and service quality. The findings reveal that this relationship is particularly strong in cultures that are short-term oriented and indulgent, as well as in professional services and service shops compared to mass services. However, the study also notes that the EI-service quality relationship remains consistent across different cultural dimensions, such as masculinity versus femininity and levels of uncertainty avoidance."
