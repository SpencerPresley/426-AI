    "detailed_summary": "This research paper addresses the challenges of implementing case-based teaching in universities where this approach is not commonly used. It presents effective methods for introducing the case analysis process, aimed at enhancing both student performance and faculty efficiency. Experiment 1 demonstrates that a semistructured one-page written case analysis is more effective than traditional methods, resulting in reduced grading time and improved student grades. Experiment 2 tests a two-case method, incorporating a brief lecture and small group practice, which further enhances student performance. The paper concludes with discussions on theoretical implications and suggestions for future research, emphasizing the importance of effective teaching strategies in higher education."
