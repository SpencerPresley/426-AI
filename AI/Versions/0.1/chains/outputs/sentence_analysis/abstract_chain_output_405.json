    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates how startup regulations and institutional quality influence new business activity across 119 countries from 2001 to 2012. The findings reveal that countries with high barriers to entry and poor-quality governmental institutions experience significantly lower rates of new business formation. Specifically, for each additional step required to start a business, entrepreneurial activity declines by 3% to 7%. Conversely, enhancing the overall average level of institutional quality by one standard deviation is linked to a 34% increase in new business activity. The study underscores the importance of regulatory and institutional environments in fostering entrepreneurship."
