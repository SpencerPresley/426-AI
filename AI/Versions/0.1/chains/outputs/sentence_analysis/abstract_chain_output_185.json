    "detailed_summary": "This research paper presents the synthesis of a new hydrophilic ligand based on the 6,6 '-bis(1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-2,2 '-bipyridine (BTzBP) structural core, which consists only of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The study emphasizes the importance of adding water-soluble groups to extractant ligands, as this can enhance the efficiency of separating 4f and transuranic 5f elements from spent nuclear fuel. It highlights that soft, nitrogen-donor ligands have a higher binding affinity for trivalent actinides compared to trivalent lanthanides, positioning BTzBP ligands as promising candidates for industrial applications in nuclear waste extraction. While hydrophobic BTzBPs have been studied for their favorable properties in nuclear waste processing, this research fills a gap by reporting the synthesis of hydrophilic BTzBPs, specifically those with cationic water-solubilizing groups attached to the bipyridyl rings, thereby expanding the potential for effective nuclear waste management strategies."
