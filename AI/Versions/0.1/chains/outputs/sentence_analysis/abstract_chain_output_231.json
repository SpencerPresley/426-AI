    "detailed_summary": "This research examines the health concern of sexual victimization among college students, focusing on the role of empathy towards rape victims. The study involved 531 undergraduates who reported their experiences with sexual victimization and their levels of empathy. Findings indicated that acknowledged victims displayed higher empathy levels than unacknowledged victims and nonvictims, with unacknowledged female victims showing greater empathy than their male counterparts. Furthermore, it was noted that victimized men were less likely to acknowledge their experiences than women. The study suggests that the acknowledgment of victimization is crucial in understanding empathy levels, with implications for prevention and victim support strategies, particularly emphasizing the need to address male victims who may be overlooked. Additionally, the research offers insights into how gender differences in acknowledgment may influence previously reported disparities in rape empathy."
