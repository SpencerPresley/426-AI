    "overall_theme": "The research explores the evolving roles of frontline employees in retail due to external pressures, focusing on the enforcement of policies related to customer behavior and its impact on employees and managers.",
    "detailed_summary": "The research paper investigates how recent disruptions, labor shortages, and fiscal pressures have changed the responsibilities of frontline employees in retail service environments, particularly in enforcing health mandates and managing customer deviant behavior (CDB). While previous studies have looked at the effects of policing on customers and businesses, they have not sufficiently examined the policies themselves and their effects on frontline employees (FLEs) and their managers (FLMs). To address this gap, the authors employed a multi-method approach that included qualitative exploration, experiments, and surveys. The qualitative component focused on employees' feelings about CDB and created a new typology of guardianship policies. The subsequent studies tested this typology in the context of shoplifting, analyzing various contextual factors that influence perceptions of policy fairness and turnover intentions. The findings contribute valuable insights for practitioners and scholars, offering a new guardianship typology and a comprehensive agenda for future research."
