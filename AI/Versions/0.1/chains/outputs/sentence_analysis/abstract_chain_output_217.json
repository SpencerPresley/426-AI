    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) detection techniques to monitor the invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas) in estuarine environments, an area where such methods have been minimally applied. The research evaluates how different life stages of the crab (including sex, molt stage, and ovigery) affect eDNA detection rates. Initial field experiments in a local salt marsh found no detectable eDNA from crabs in sediment samples. In laboratory trials, aquaria with crabs at various life stages were used to test the hypothesis that eDNA levels are higher when crabs are ovigerous or in greater abundance. Samples were taken over several time points, and analysis revealed that while eDNA was detected in all experimental setups, concentrations were low in non-ovigerous treatments. Notably, eDNA levels were higher in sediment than in water for male and ovigerous crabs. Overall, the study found that C. maenas shed low levels of eDNA during most of their life cycle, underscoring the need to consider life stage and sampling methods when monitoring crustaceans in estuarine environments."
