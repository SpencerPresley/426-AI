    "detailed_summary": "This research utilizes data from the APOGEE survey to analyze the relationship between stellar parameters and multiplicity among dwarf and subgiant stars. By combining high-resolution spectroscopy and abundance measurements, the study focuses on stellar multiples with periods under 30 years. The findings indicate that chemical composition is the primary factor influencing the close binary fraction, overshadowing other parameters like mass and age. Notably, a strong anticorrelation is confirmed between the close binary fraction and metallicity, with high alpha element abundances further reducing multiplicity. The analysis reveals that the relationship between alpha abundances and multiplicity is more pronounced than that of iron, suggesting a significant role of certain elements in star formation processes. The study presents quantitative evidence of how the close binary fraction decreases with increasing alpha abundances, emphasizing the need for future research to consider the complex interplay between stellar multiplicity and chemical composition in the Milky Way."
