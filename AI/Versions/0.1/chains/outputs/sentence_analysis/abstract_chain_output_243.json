    "detailed_summary": "This study addresses a gap in research concerning multilingual students who are not classified as English language learners (ELLs) in English language arts (ELA) classes. It focuses on a group of multilingual girls taught by a monolingual white teacher and aims to demonstrate how creating space for translanguaging practices allows these students to challenge the exclusive use of English in the classroom. Utilizing reconstructive discourse analysis, the authors examine data from classroom observations, writing samples, and recorded discussions to understand how these students employ multilingualism, primarily in spoken interactions. The findings reveal that translanguaging is most prominent in small-group discussions, where students engage in collaborative writing processes and express their feelings about writing. Notably, Spanish is used to enhance writing quality, suggesting that multilingualism contributes positively to academic proficiency. The authors advocate for a more expansive approach to data analysis that recognizes the strengths of multilingual students in predominantly English-speaking environments, promoting anti-deficit literacy development. By analyzing classroom discourse alongside literacy, the study provides a nuanced understanding of translanguaging practices and demonstrates how even monolingual teachers can create inclusive environments that support multilingual learners."
