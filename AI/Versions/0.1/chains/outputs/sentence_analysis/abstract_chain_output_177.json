    "detailed_summary": "The research paper discusses the 'Great Challenges for Social Work' and introduces the concept of a 'radical imaginary' as a framework for developing a just ethics infrastructure over the next decade, emphasizing the importance of race, ethnicity, and culture. It critiques the current issues stemming from rigid moral standards and a Eurocentric ethics curriculum. To address these challenges, the authors propose three change processes aimed at creating a more equitable and inclusive ethical practice. The 'radical imaginary' is positioned as a tool to promote anti-racist and anti-oppressive ethics, striving to eradicate both ethical social isolation and racism rooted in ethical perspectives."
