    "detailed_summary": "This study examines the evolutionary relationship between brain and body sizes in birds, highlighting that while birds can have impressive brain sizes comparable to primates, the overall patterns and drivers of their brain evolution are not well understood. Utilizing a dataset of over 2,000 species, including modern birds and their ancestors, the research uncovers that there was no significant increase in relative brain size during the miniaturization and flight evolution of theropods. It finds that theropods and basal birds exhibited weaker correlations between brain and body sizes, allowing for rapid evolutionary changes. Post-Cretaceous-Paleogene mass extinction, several bird clades experienced increases in relative brain size due to body size reduction. Parrots and corvids, which have the largest brains among birds, achieved this through different evolutionary strategies: parrots reduced body size while corvids increased both body and brain sizes. Overall, the study suggests that early adaptations in brain size may have laid the groundwork for future evolutionary stability and selection in birds."
