    "detailed_summary": "This research paper addresses the often-overlooked influence of associations in the discourse on diversity in economics, particularly focusing on the Northeastern Agriculture and Resource Economics Association (NAREA). The authors analyze membership and meeting attendance patterns to promote diversity, employing a vector error correction model (VECM) and member survey data to identify determinants of participation. Their findings reveal significant inequalities based on gender, income, and professional status. To mitigate these disparities, the authors recommend strategic actions such as holding meetings in more accessible locations, enhancing networking opportunities, and offering tailored services to support underrepresented groups in the field."
