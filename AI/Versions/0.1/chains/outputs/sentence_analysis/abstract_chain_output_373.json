    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the rising cases of reptile-associated salmonellosis in the U.S., particularly focusing on healthy turtles shedding Salmonella enterica. It highlights knowledge gaps regarding the rate of bacterial shedding and the ecological role of turtles as indicators of Salmonella transmission. Conducted between 2012 and 2013 in Clarke and Oconee Counties, Georgia, the study assessed Salmonella prevalence in free-living aquatic turtles and correlated various ecological and demographic factors. Results showed that 23.2% of turtles were positive for Salmonella, with higher prevalence in juveniles, females, and bottom-dwelling species. Environmental factors such as forest cover and distance from roads were linked to lower prevalence rates. The study identified nine serovars, with a significant genetic match between turtle and human isolates, suggesting potential transmission pathways. The findings underscore the importance of turtles in monitoring environmental contamination and raise significant public health concerns regarding Salmonella transmission from wildlife to humans."
