    "detailed_summary": "This paper investigates the dynamics of two-sided B2B electronic markets, where a platform firm acts as a market-maker facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers. It specifically examines how governance processes, both formal (monitoring) and informal (procedural fairness), affect seller performance in relation to buyers. The authors introduce structural attributes of the platform firm, such as self-participation and investments, as moderators that influence this relationship. The findings reveal that both monitoring and procedural fairness independently enhance seller performance. However, the moderating effects of self-participation and investments differ: self-participation boosts the effectiveness of procedural fairness but reduces the impact of monitoring, while investments do the reverse. The research concludes with practical recommendations for platform managers, suggesting two distinct 'choice-packages' of governance processes and structural attributes to optimize participant performance."
