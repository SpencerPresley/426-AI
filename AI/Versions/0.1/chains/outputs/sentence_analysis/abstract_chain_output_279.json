However, the study finds that while these funds had positive returns prior to the crisis, their performance declined after 2009 as many investors adopted similar strategies, leading to overcrowding in the market. Additionally, the research suggests that investor sentiment plays a crucial role in the flow of capital into these funds, with increased investments occurring during periods of low sentiment, indicating their use as a hedge against financial risk."
