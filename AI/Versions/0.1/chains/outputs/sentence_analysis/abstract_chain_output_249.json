    "overall_theme": "The research presents a novel framework for analyzing language use, particularly in multilingual contexts, emphasizing the influence of historical and social factors on language perception and utilization.",
    "detailed_summary": "This research article introduces a chronotopic-scalar system to analyze language use, particularly in multilingual settings, drawing on data from Iranian Azerbaijanis. It posits that the availability and categorization of linguistic resources are shaped by individuals' historical experiences related to time and space. The author argues that socialization creates 'scaled images' that guide language use within specific contexts. Furthermore, the article highlights the significance of understanding the spatial and temporal dimensions of language resources to address ongoing debates about the authenticity of languages and the nature of multilingual practices. By decentralizing the concept of language and focusing on context, the study aims to provide insights into how individuals use language and form ideologies about it, challenging the notion of languages as discrete systems."
