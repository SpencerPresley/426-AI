    "detailed_summary": "This research paper examines how entry regulations, such as fees, permits, and licenses, create barriers for low-income individuals attempting to enter various industries, thereby increasing income inequality. The authors empirically analyze data from 115 countries, combining entry regulations from the World Bank's Doing Business Index with measures of income inequality, including Gini coefficients. Their findings indicate that countries with stricter entry regulations experience higher levels of income inequality. Specifically, in nations with average inequality, a one standard deviation increase in the number of procedures required to start a business correlates with a 7.2% rise in income share for the top decile and a 12.9% increase in the Gini coefficient. These results remain consistent across different measures of inequality and potential confounding factors. The paper concludes by proposing policy recommendations aimed at reducing the negative impacts of entry regulations on income inequality."
