            "reasoning": "The phrase 'well-established' indicates that research has confirmed this relationship, while 'nascent stage' suggests that the underlying mechanisms are still being explored.",

            "reasoning": "The term 'multisource data' suggests diverse input, and 'mediating effect' indicates that coworker support plays a crucial role in how leader integrity influences autonomy.",

    "detailed_summary": "This paper explores the established positive relationship between leader behavioral integrity and employee in-role performance, while acknowledging that the reasons behind this relationship are still developing. Utilizing leader behavioral integrity theory and job-demands resources theory, the authors explain how leader integrity promotes employee performance and the factors that influence this effect. The study employs multisource data from 209 employee-manager dyads in South Korea, revealing that coworker support mediates the relationship between leader integrity and employee autonomy. Notably, the positive indirect effect of leader integrity on performance through coworker support is stronger for employees who perceive high job autonomy compared to those with low autonomy. The findings underscore the significance of a leader's integrity and job resources in fostering supportive team dynamics that enhance employee performance. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of these findings."
