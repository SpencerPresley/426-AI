            "reasoning": "The term 'multisource data' implies a comprehensive data collection method, while 'mediated relationship' indicates a complex interaction between variables. The mention of 'core-self evaluations' suggests that individual differences among employees play a significant role.",

            "meaning": "Employees with strong core self-evaluations are less affected by negative customer interactions in terms of their intrinsic motivation and subsequent service performance compared to those with weaker core self-evaluations.",
            "reasoning": "The comparison between high and low levels of core self-evaluations indicates a moderating effect, suggesting that some employees are more resilient to negative customer behavior than others.",

    "detailed_summary": "This research paper explores the relationship between customer incivility and employee service performance through the lens of self-determination theory. It presents an integrative framework to explain the conditions under which customer rudeness negatively impacts employee motivation and performance. Utilizing multisource data collected over two waves in a shopping mall, the study finds that the effect of customer incivility on employee performance, mediated by intrinsic motivation, is influenced by the employees' core self-evaluations. Specifically, employees with higher core self-evaluations experience a weaker negative impact from customer incivility compared to those with lower evaluations. This suggests that individual differences in self-perception and resilience play a critical role in how employees respond to challenging customer interactions."
