    "detailed_summary": "This research paper investigates the quality of first job placements for professional Asian nationals compared to non-Asian nationals in the USA. It highlights the significant influx of Asian professionals into the US labor market over the past decade and suggests that this could lead to inefficient and discriminatory job placements. The study focuses on newly hired assistant professors in research-intensive universities from 2010 to 2021, analyzing the quality of the universities where these professionals are placed. The findings reveal that, while Asian nationals exhibit higher performance in terms of publication records, they are often placed in lower-quality universities than their non-Asian peers. Furthermore, Asian professionals must present strong performance indicators, such as first or second authorship on publications, to mitigate the placement gap. The results point to a combination of direct bias against Asian applicants and a heightened 'burden of proof' for their qualifications compared to non-Asian nationals, highlighting systemic issues in academic hiring practices."
