    "detailed_summary": "This research paper focuses on assessing the effectiveness of an oral hygiene promoting program (OHPP) using a smartphone endomicroscope for elementary school students in Bangkok, Thailand. The study is designed as a quasi-experimental research with a sample of 59 fifth graders, divided into an experimental group of 29 students participating in the OHPP and a control group of 30 students receiving standard oral health education. The researchers conducted pretests, posttests, and follow-up assessments to evaluate oral health behaviors, specifically knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP), along with oral hygiene. The analysis utilized multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to compare outcomes between the groups. Results indicated that the experimental group showed significant improvements in oral health behaviors and hygiene related to teeth cleanliness and gum health compared to the control group, although no significant differences were found regarding tongue cleanliness. The study concludes that the program effectively supports students in maintaining their oral hygiene through engaging activities, aided by the smartphone endomicroscope, which allows them to observe their oral health conditions such as tooth decay and plaque."
