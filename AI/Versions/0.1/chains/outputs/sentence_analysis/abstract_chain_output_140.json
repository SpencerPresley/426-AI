    "detailed_summary": "This study explores how evolutionary changes in species, particularly in anurans (frogs), affect the coordination of neurological and morphological structures that facilitate communication. It emphasizes the importance of this coordination for effective information transfer among individuals. The researchers compiled and analyzed data on auditory morphology, hearing sensitivity, and call-dominant frequency across 81 species of anurans. They found significant scaling effects of body size on various features and preliminary evidence suggesting that morphological evolution can influence hearing sensitivity and call frequency beyond size-related changes. The study concludes that these findings provide essential insights into the constraints of body size on communication systems and highlight the need for further comparative research across anuran species."
