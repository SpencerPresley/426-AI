    "detailed_summary": "This study explores the consequences of chemical treatments used in cattle farming on dung beetle populations in Maryland, USA. Researchers compared dung beetle communities across 19 farms, categorizing them into those using chemicals for pest control (CU) and those that did not (NCU). Monthly baiting with fresh cattle dung was employed, resulting in the collection of 31 species and 12,380 individual specimens. The analysis revealed that the five most abundant species accounted for 85% of the samples, yet there was no significant difference in total beetle abundance between CU and NCU farms. However, a notable temporal effect was observed, indicating that beetle populations varied by month. Further analysis identified site location, soil type, and chemical lethality as important factors influencing beetle abundances. The research underscores the complexity of current agricultural practices and their implications for dung beetle biodiversity and abundance, aiming to enhance understanding of the ecological roles these beetles play."
