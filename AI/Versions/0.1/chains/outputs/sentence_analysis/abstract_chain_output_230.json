    "detailed_summary": "This study focuses on El Yunque National Forest in Puerto Rico, which hosts diverse ecosystems sensitive to climate variations. It highlights the urgency of understanding local hydroclimate changes in light of global climate models predicting reduced precipitation in the Caribbean. The researchers downscale predictions from the IPCC CMIP5 project to assess future rainfall variability during the early rainfall season (ERS). They develop an artificial neural network (ANN) that uses specific atmospheric variables to forecast dry and wet days, achieving a 92% accuracy rate during the historical period from 1985 to 2016. The findings indicate a projected 7.2% increase in dry-day frequency by mid-century, with a corresponding decrease in seasonal precipitation by approximately 200 mm. The study attributes these changes to increased bulk wind shear and unfavorable thermodynamic conditions. Interestingly, the ensemble model predicts a recovery of dry-day frequency towards historical averages by the end of the century, suggesting potential changes in future climate patterns."
