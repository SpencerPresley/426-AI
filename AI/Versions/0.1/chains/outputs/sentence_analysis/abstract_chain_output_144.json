    "detailed_summary": "The abstract presents the eighteenth data release (DR18) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which is significant as it marks the first release for the fifth generation, SDSS-V. This new generation includes three main scientific programs: the Milky Way Mapper (MWM), the Black Hole Mapper (BHM), and the Local Volume Mapper, each targeting different astronomical research areas. The release provides comprehensive targeting information for the MWM and BHM, detailing input catalogs and selection functions that support various scientific objectives. The authors describe the methods used to produce and calibrate the targeting databases. Additionally, DR18 features approximately 25,000 new SDSS spectra and supplementary data related to X-ray sources identified by eROSITA in its eFEDS field. The authors also outline updates to the SDSS software pipelines and give a preview of anticipated changes for the next release, DR19. Furthermore, they mention three value-added catalogs (VACs) based on SDSS-IV data published since the previous release (DR17) and one VAC based on SDSS-V data in the eFEDS field, highlighting the ongoing enhancement of the SDSS dataset."
