    "detailed_summary": "This study investigates the link between sleep and obesity in young adults, particularly focusing on college students. Utilizing a 40-item survey with a response rate of 72%, the research analyzed data from 1578 students aged 18-25 across five universities in the U.S. and South Korea. Objective measurements of weight and height were taken, while other health behaviors were self-reported. The study employed multinomial logistic regression and Poisson regression to assess associations between sleep patterns and variables like race, gender, and BMI. Key findings indicated that Black participants had a higher likelihood of experiencing short sleep compared to Whites, and overweight individuals also exhibited a greater risk of both short and long sleep durations. Sleep quality was notably poorer among Black and South Korean participants and among those with obesity. The study concludes that obesity is linked to both insufficient and excessive sleep durations and poor sleep quality, highlighting the need for further research to identify at-risk populations for obesity and sleep issues."
