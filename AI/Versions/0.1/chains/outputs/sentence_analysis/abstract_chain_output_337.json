    "detailed_summary": "The abstract discusses the development and subsequent updates of the Guidelines for Biosafety in Teaching Laboratories, originally created in 2012 following a Salmonella Typhimurium outbreak linked to microbiology labs. Over the next seven years, two additional outbreaks were reported, prompting the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) to track the usage and issues faced by its members regarding the guidelines. In 2018, it was determined that an update was necessary, leading the ASM Education Board to form a task force for this purpose. The updated guidelines combine the previously separate BSL1 and BSL2 sections into a single document to reduce redundancy and confusion, and they now include new sections on risk assessment and service animals. These revisions are intended to address the challenges users experienced with the original guidelines, thereby enhancing their effectiveness in teaching laboratories."
