    "detailed_summary": "This study examines how team members' actual expertise and social status affect their influence over team processes through perceived expertise, guided by expectation states theory and expertise utilization literature. It explores the conditions under which teams prioritize perceived expertise or social status, presenting a contingency model that links the importance of these factors to types of intragroup conflicts. Utilizing multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams at a national research institute in South Korea, the findings reveal that both actual expertise and social status have direct and indirect effects on member influence through perceived expertise. Notably, social status drives perceived expertise in the early stages of projects, while actual expertise becomes more significant in later stages. Additionally, perceived experts are more influential in high task conflict situations or low relationship conflict scenarios. The authors conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for future research and practical applications in team dynamics."
