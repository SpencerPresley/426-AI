With a participant pool of 195 older Koreans, the research highlights the limitations of single-frequency BIA methods, which can lead to inaccurate ALM estimates. The study aims to validate a muscle-specific BIA equation using multiple frequencies, employing regression analyses to derive predictive variables and develop ALM equations. The results show that the 2 MHz impedance index explains a significant portion of ALM variability, with high predictive accuracy. The final regression equation demonstrates excellent diagnostic performance for sarcopenia, achieving high sensitivity and specificity. Ultimately, the new high-frequency BIA equation is deemed suitable for both epidemiological studies and clinical diagnosis, marking a significant advancement in the assessment of sarcopenia."
