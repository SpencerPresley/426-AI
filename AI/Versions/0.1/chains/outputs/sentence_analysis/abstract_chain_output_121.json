    "detailed_summary": "This research paper introduces a finite volume-alternating direction implicit method designed for the numerical valuation of American options within the framework of the Heston model. The method is characterized by the decoupling of the stock price process from the volatility process, which simplifies the associated partial differential operator by removing mixed partial derivative terms. This simplification contributes to the method's numerical efficiency, making it both simple and fast to implement. The authors validate their approach by presenting numerical results that assess the accuracy of their method and compare its performance to other existing valuation techniques, demonstrating its effectiveness in the field of financial mathematics."
