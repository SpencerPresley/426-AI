            "reasoning": "The use of 'documents' suggests a formal reporting of information, and the terms 'seventeenth data release' and 'final release' indicate a specific milestone in the research project.",

            "reasoning": "The term 'accompanies' suggests that the Stellar Library is supplementary to the MaNGA data, and 'bright time' refers to periods when observations can be made effectively.",

            "meaning": "DR17 introduces new optical spectroscopy data obtained from specific surveys, namely the ERosita and eBOSS-RM programs.",
            "reasoning": "The term 'new' indicates that this data is being introduced for the first time in DR17, while the names of the surveys specify the sources of this data.",

    "detailed_summary": "This research paper presents the seventeenth data release (DR17) from the Sloan Digital Sky Surveys, which is the final release from the fourth phase (SDSS-IV). It includes the complete data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, which achieved its goal of surveying over 10,000 nearby galaxies. Additionally, the MaNGA Stellar Library is fully released, containing observations of nearly 30,000 stars. DR17 also features the complete release of the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2, which provides infrared spectra for over 650,000 stars. The previous data release (DR16) included the main samples from the Extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) and Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey. New data from the SPectroscipic IDentification of ERosita Survey and the eBOSS-RM program are introduced in DR17, along with 25 new or updated value-added catalogs. This paper signifies the end of SDSS-IV survey data releases, while announcing the continuation into the fifth phase with new observational projects focused on mapping the Milky Way, local volume, and black holes."
