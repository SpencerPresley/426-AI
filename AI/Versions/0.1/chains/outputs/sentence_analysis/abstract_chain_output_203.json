    "detailed_summary": "This research paper emphasizes the importance of contextual interpretation of data as a key educational outcome. It proposes a method for assessing students' skills in this area by examining the interplay between contextual and statistical reasoning. The method consists of two stages: the first utilizes Toulmin's model of argumentation to analyze students' justifications and uncertainties in their interpretive arguments, while the second employs the SOLO model to evaluate and compare the quality of these arguments. The authors draw on existing literature and provide an empirical example to illustrate how these models can work together effectively. Furthermore, they argue that using both Toulmin and SOLO in conjunction addresses theoretical and practical limitations inherent in using either model alone, thereby offering a more robust framework for analyzing student interpretations of contextualized data."
