    "detailed_summary": "The research paper emphasizes the necessity for more studies focusing on affirming parents of pre-adolescent transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) children. It specifically investigates how these parents view their roles as advocates. The study involved semi-structured phone interviews with eleven parents of TGNC children aged 13 and under. Results indicated that ten out of eleven parents identified as advocates, with a notable emphasis on digital advocacy. Their motivations for advocacy were primarily rooted in concerns for their children's well-being. However, opinions varied on whether this advocacy positively influenced their relationships with their children, highlighting a divide among parents. A significant shared concern among the parents was the issue of privacy rights for TGNC youth. The findings suggest potential strategies for mobilizing and supporting parents of TGNC youth in advocacy efforts."
