    "summary": "The research explores the life of Jien, a significant figure within the Tendai Buddhist establishment, whose rise and fall were influenced by his familial ties to the state bureaucracy. It highlights the complexities of Jien's identity as both a cleric and a politician, suggesting that existing academic interpretations fail to capture the full scope of his motivations. The author aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Jien by examining various sources related to his life, including his spiritual authority, his role in supporting disciples, and his prophetic vision. A key argument is that Jien's spiritual worldview is essential to understanding his actions, particularly during a notable confrontation with Retired Emperor Gotoba, emphasizing the need to reconcile his political and religious interests.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main themes of the research, focusing on Jien's dual identity and the impact of his background on his life and actions. It reflects the author's intent to provide a holistic understanding of Jien by analyzing various aspects of his life, without delving into the specific methodologies used in the research. The key points regarding Jien's spiritual worldview and the significance of his confrontation with the Retired Emperor are emphasized, aligning with the abstract's core arguments.",
