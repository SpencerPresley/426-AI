    "summary": "This research emphasizes the critical need for understanding the interactions between non-human primates and mangrove forests to enhance conservation efforts. It highlights the creation of the MangPrim-21 database, which provides a comprehensive mapping of these interactions globally. The findings reveal that a significant portion of non-primates utilize mangrove forests, with specific countries identified as having notable interactions. The study also points out critical locations in Kalimantan and discusses the broader implications for conservation strategies, challenging existing notions about the role of mangrove forests as mere refuges for non-human primates.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the importance of understanding habitat and species interactions for conservation, the establishment of a database as a key tool for this understanding, and the significant findings regarding the usage of mangrove forests by non-human primates. It also addresses the implications of the research for conservation efforts and critiques prevailing assumptions about mangrove forests.",
