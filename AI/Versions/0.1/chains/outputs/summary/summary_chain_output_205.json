    "summary": "This research investigates the governance modes employed by international franchisors when entering foreign markets, focusing on how environmental uncertainties and market characteristics influence these decisions. The study finds that franchisors tend to adopt governance modes with lower levels of control in the face of challenges such as corruption, economic downturns, and significant geographic distances. Additionally, the assets of the franchise system and local market resources also play a crucial role in determining governance choices. The research highlights the necessity for firms to balance the risks associated with environmental uncertainties against the need to protect their capabilities, noting that this balance evolves with the franchisor's experience in local markets and the maturation of once-emerging markets. Furthermore, the study identifies new governance modes and supports key aspects of an existing theoretical model of franchisor governance mode choice.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main findings and implications of the research, emphasizing the factors influencing governance mode selection by franchisors. It avoids specific methodological details while providing a clear picture of the study's contributions to understanding governance strategies in international franchising. The reasoning is based on the abstract's focus on the interplay between environmental factors, governance modes, and the experience of franchisors, which are central to the research's purpose and findings.",
