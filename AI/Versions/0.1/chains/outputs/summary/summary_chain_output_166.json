    "summary": "This research investigates the significance of co-creation in online healthcare communities (OHCs) and identifies key social and technical factors that influence patient value co-creation. It highlights the necessity for further exploration into these factors, revealing that social support is the most influential element compared to other factors such as government IT infrastructures and control of information. The findings emphasize the role of social support and its antecedents, including perceived privacy risk and social media interactivity, in fostering value co-creation within OHCs. The study concludes with a discussion on the theoretical and practical implications of these insights for improving public health and well-being.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main findings and contributions of the research without delving into specific methods. It clearly outlines the focus on co-creation in OHCs, the identification of critical factors influencing this process, and the emphasis on social support as a primary driver. The reasoning is based on the overall theme of the abstract, which discusses the interplay of social and technical elements in enhancing patient engagement and value co-creation in healthcare contexts.",
