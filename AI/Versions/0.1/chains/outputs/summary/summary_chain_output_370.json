    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of climate change and land-use change on the sex ratios of spotted turtles, a species with temperature-dependent sex determination. The study reveals that climate change may lead to skewed sex ratios, particularly increasing female proportions in warmer regions, while cooler areas show a trend towards more males with rising temperatures. The authors suggest that these patterns are influenced by the turtles' adaptive behaviors and the spatial arrangement of wetlands in relation to agricultural practices. Overall, the findings highlight the complexities of how environmental changes affect wildlife demographics, emphasizing the significance of landscape structure.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is the relationship between climate change, land use, and the sex ratios of spotted turtles. It synthesizes the key findings regarding how temperature influences sex ratios differently across geographic areas and discusses the implications of these findings for understanding species responses to environmental changes. The reasoning reflects the core themes and results of the study without delving into specific methodologies.",
