    "summary": "The research paper examines the relationship between community violence exposure and civic engagement among marginalized youth, highlighting that these youth are often less civically engaged despite being disproportionately affected by violence. It identifies a gap in the literature regarding how these experiences are interconnected and influenced by various external factors. The authors review existing literature to understand how developmental assets and neighborhood collective efficacy might enhance civic engagement in this demographic. They propose several hypotheses for further investigation into the link between community violence and civic engagement and aim to identify intervention opportunities to improve civic participation among affected youth.",
