    "summary": "This research investigates the influence of skepticism on individuals' attitudes towards electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), particularly focusing on three dimensions of skepticism: suspicion of motivation, suspicion of truthfulness, and suspicion of identity. The study explores how these dimensions interact and which is most impactful in assessing the credibility of eWOM messages. Additionally, it examines the role of individual traits, such as dispositional trust and perceptions of structural assurance, in shaping these skepticism dimensions. The findings indicate that suspicion of identity significantly affects credibility assessments, while lower levels of trust correlate with heightened skepticism regarding motivation and truthfulness. The research emphasizes the need for improved protective measures on eWOM platforms and suggests stricter regulations to combat misinformation. Overall, it contributes to the understanding of eWOM skepticism as a formative construct affecting message credibility.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research by outlining its focus on skepticism in eWOM and the specific dimensions being studied. It highlights the relationships between these dimensions and their impact on credibility assessments, as well as the implications for eWOM practices. The summary avoids mentioning specific methodologies, aligning with the requirement to focus on the main ideas rather than the methods used in the research.",
