    "summary": "This study investigates the trends in opioid and non-opioid medication use among pediatric cancer patients in the United States, highlighting a significant decline in opioid prescriptions and a corresponding increase in the use of alternative non-opioid medications. The research draws on a large dataset to analyze prescription patterns over time, revealing that while opioid use peaked around 2012, it has since decreased, whereas prescriptions for anticonvulsants, NSAIDs, and muscle relaxants have seen a steady rise. This shift suggests a changing approach to pain management in this vulnerable population, potentially reflecting a broader move away from opioid dependence.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core findings and implications of the research without delving into specific methodologies. It effectively outlines the context (pediatric cancer patients), the focus (trends in medication use), and the significant results (decline in opioid prescriptions and rise in non-opioid alternatives) while maintaining a clear narrative about the changing landscape of pain management in this demographic.",
