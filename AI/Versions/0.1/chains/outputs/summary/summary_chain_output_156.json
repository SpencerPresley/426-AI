    "summary": "The research investigates the relationship between shareholder coordination and corporate innovation, finding that closer geographic proximity among institutional investors is linked to improved innovation outcomes. This effect is particularly strong among dedicated and independent institutions that possess strong monitoring incentives, especially in firms with lower blockholder ownership and higher information asymmetry. The authors propose that enhanced shareholder coordination reduces managerial agency problems, allowing diffuse shareholders to monitor management more effectively, which in turn fosters corporate innovation.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core findings of the research, emphasizing the positive correlation between shareholder coordination and innovation, the conditions that enhance this relationship, and the mechanism through which monitoring alleviates agency problems. It avoids discussing the specific methodologies, focusing instead on the implications and outcomes of the research.",
