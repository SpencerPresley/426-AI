    "summary": "This research addresses the lack of opportunities for nursing students to interact with individuals suffering from mental illness, which is often due to limited clinical sites. To remedy this, a collaborative educational strategy was implemented involving theater students acting as standardized patients. Over two years, this initiative has engaged 10 theater students and 180 nursing students, resulting in notable improvements in the communication skills of the nursing students. As a pilot project, further research is recommended to evaluate its effectiveness for both groups.",
