    "summary": "This research investigates the self-assessment practices of 105 diverse middle-school students regarding their reading and writing skills during a summer enrichment program. The findings reveal that the students' perceptions of language and literacy are significantly influenced by traditional norms, which are metaphorically described as 'hauntings.' The students tended to focus more on superficial aspects of literacy, such as speed and volume, rather than deeper meaning. This suggests that conventional definitions of literacy remain dominant among youth, highlighting the necessity for educational approaches that challenge these limited definitions to foster a more comprehensive understanding of literacy.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by outlining the focus on students' self-assessments and the influence of traditional literacy ideologies. It emphasizes the findings that students prioritize surface features over deeper meanings in their literacy evaluations, leading to a conclusion about the need for educational reform. The reasoning connects the key elements of the abstract, including the metaphorical language used to describe the influence of standard language ideology, and highlights the implications for teaching practices.",
