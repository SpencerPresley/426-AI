    "summary": "This research paper discusses the critical role of social work in the contemporary human rights discourse, emphasizing the profession's foundational values of social justice and respect for individuals. It highlights a general lack of focus on human rights within social work education in the United States, despite the recognition among international scholars that social work is intrinsically linked to human rights. The authors argue that equipping social work students with knowledge and skills related to human rights is essential, especially in light of current global and domestic challenges. The paper reviews existing literature on the integration of human rights into social work education and identifies three key areas of focus: general integration strategies, pedagogical frameworks for teaching human rights, and evaluation measures for assessing this integration. The findings suggest that the incorporation of human rights in social work education is still in its early stages, leading to a recommendation for more intentional curriculum development to prepare culturally competent and globally aware social workers.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research by outlining the connection between social work and human rights, the current state of human rights education within social work programs, and the recommendations for improvement. It reflects the emphasis on the need for integrating human rights into the curriculum to better prepare future social workers, as indicated in the abstract. The reasoning for this summary is based on the detailed analysis of the abstract's content, including its themes and findings.",
