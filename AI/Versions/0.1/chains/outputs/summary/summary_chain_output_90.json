    "summary": "This research investigates the lives of two rural women who are creative writers, focusing on their motivations for writing and how their identities as women intersect with their rural experiences. The study reveals that the women utilize creative writing as a means of engaging with and disseminating knowledge, challenging traditional notions of womanhood and addressing societal issues related to gender, sexuality, race, and rurality. Their writings articulate shared truths and reflect their unique intersectional identities. Furthermore, the study emphasizes a shift in critical literacy from a focus on pedagogy to empowering individuals to use writing as a tool for advocacy and self-expression beyond educational contexts.",
