    "summary": "This research investigates the effect of a local earned income tax credit (EITC) program implemented in Montgomery County, Maryland, in 1998, on birth outcomes, specifically birth weight and the likelihood of low birth weight among mothers. By analyzing birth data from 1995 to 2004, the study finds that the EITC significantly reduced the probability of low birth weight by 1.9 to 2.4 percentage points for likely eligible mothers. The findings contribute to existing literature on the positive impacts of EITC programs on birth outcomes.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is the relationship between the EITC program and birth outcomes in Montgomery County.
