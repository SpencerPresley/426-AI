    "summary": "This research extends existing studies on human resource compensation by exploring how risk components in executive pay influence strategic outcomes within firms, specifically focusing on strategic variation and deviation from industry norms. The authors investigate the moderating role of previous financial performance and total shareholder return (TSR) in this relationship. The findings indicate that both high- and low-risk components of compensation significantly affect strategic changes, with TSR acting as a crucial moderating factor. The study highlights practical implications for corporate governance, suggesting that boards of directors can mitigate biases in principal-agent relationships by analyzing compensation based on risk components. Overall, this research contributes to strategy literature by emphasizing the importance of compensation schema in shaping strategic decisions made by executives.",
