    "summary": "This research investigates the function of female song in eastern bluebirds, addressing the previously overlooked role of female bird song, particularly in temperate species. While male songbirds have historically been recognized for their vocalizations aimed at attracting mates and competing with other males, it is acknowledged that female song exists in many tropical species. However, studies on female song in temperate regions have been limited. The authors aim to enhance understanding of female song functions, which may provide insights into the evolutionary pressures influencing female vocalizations. The findings reveal that female song primarily serves the purpose of facilitating pair communication and strengthening long-term pair bonds, which is beneficial for reproductive success. The study establishes a connection between the function of female song and the evolutionary advantages of maintaining these bonds in eastern bluebirds.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the essence of the research, highlighting the significance of female bird song, especially in temperate species, and its role in pair communication. It emphasizes the shift in understanding from a male-dominated perspective of bird song to recognizing the important functions of female song. The summary also reflects the research's contributions to understanding evolutionary pressures and reproductive success linked to pair bonds, which are central themes in the abstract.",
