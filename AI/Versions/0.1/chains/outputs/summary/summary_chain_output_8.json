    "summary": "This research explores how preschool children can actively engage in scientific inquiry and the evolving role of teachers in facilitating this process. It highlights the gap in understanding the specific actions teachers need to take to promote meaningful inquiry-based science education. The study reviews existing literature and aims to create a comprehensive framework that provides teachers with strategies to foster a culture of inquiry within preschool settings. By analyzing 15 studies, the research identifies five key themes that emphasize the importance of children's curiosity and interests in guiding scientific exploration. The proposed strategies are intended to be integrated into various activities, transforming play into rigorous learning experiences that cultivate a lasting culture of inquiry in the classroom.",
