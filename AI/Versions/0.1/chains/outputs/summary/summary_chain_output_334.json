    "summary": "This research investigates the thresholds for detecting vocalizations in tungara frogs, which are crucial for mate recognition and choice. The study reveals that the ability to detect these acoustic signals varies depending on the method used to assess the thresholds. Specifically, the findings indicate that the lowest detection thresholds are observed through multiunit recordings, followed by behavioral responses, while auditory brainstem responses yield the highest thresholds. The authors discuss the implications of these differences, emphasizing the importance of considering how animals perceive sound in the context of their mating behaviors.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core focus of the research, which is the examination of detection thresholds for vocalizations in frogs and their significance in mate selection. It avoids mentioning specific methodologies while highlighting the key findings and their implications. The reasoning is based on the overall theme derived from the abstract that connects vocalizations, detection thresholds, and mate choice.",
