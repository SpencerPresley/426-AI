    "summary": "This research investigates how female tungara frogs respond to male advertisement calls in noisy environments, specifically examining the role of multimodal signals (auditory and visual) in mate choice. It was hypothesized that the addition of visual signals would enhance the frogs' ability to detect and prefer attractive calls in the presence of noise. The study found that while noise did not significantly affect preferences in simpler decision-making scenarios (two choices), it did impact responses in more complex scenarios (three choices), where noise alone reduced the likelihood of selecting attractive calls. The findings challenge the assumption that multimodal signals are universally more effective in noisy conditions, suggesting instead that the complexity of the sensory environment influences audio-visual perception and decision-making in mate selection.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research by focusing on the investigation of female tungara frogs' communication strategies in noisy environments. It emphasizes the hypothesis regarding multimodal signals and discusses the outcomes related to decision-making complexity. The summary avoids detailing specific methodologies, instead concentrating on the implications of the findings and the overarching theme of the research.",
