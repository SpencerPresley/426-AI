    "summary": "This research introduces a Bayesian framework designed for parameter estimation in effective field theories, focusing specifically on nucleon-nucleon (NN) potentials derived from chiral effective field theory (chi EFT). The authors present results that highlight the significance of extensive NN scattering data, which has high precision and spans a wide energy range. They emphasize the importance of accounting for higher-order terms in chi EFT for accurate parameter estimation. The study includes two case studies: the first demonstrates that certain parameters in the fourth-order NN potential are degenerate, linked to a specific operator, while the second assesses the stability of low-energy constants when additional high-energy data is incorporated. The findings suggest that as long as truncation errors are managed, the extracted low-energy constants remain reliable regardless of the maximum energy considered. Furthermore, the authors explore different models for truncation errors, proposing the use of Gaussian processes for enhanced correlation modeling.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is the development and application of a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation in effective field theories, particularly in the context of nucleon-nucleon potentials. It outlines the key findings related to data significance, parameter stability, and the implications of higher-order terms, while avoiding specific methodological details. The reasoning also reflects the abstract's structure, emphasizing the case studies and their contributions to the overall research narrative.",
