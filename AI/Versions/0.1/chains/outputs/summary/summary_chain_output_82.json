    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of human activities, particularly agricultural expansion, on the survival of bearded capuchin monkeys in northeastern Brazil. The study highlights how these monkeys possess unique tool-use traditions that are at risk due to habitat loss. Over the past 30 years, significant changes in land cover have been observed, with agriculture increasing dramatically. The findings suggest that if current trends continue, the remaining forest area will not be sufficient to support the local capuchin population. The research underscores the necessity of incorporating behavioral traditions into conservation strategies, as these unique traits are not widely shared among the species.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the threats faced by bearded capuchins due to agricultural expansion and habitat destruction. It emphasizes the significance of their tool-use traditions and the urgency for conservation efforts that consider these cultural aspects. The reasoning is based on the detailed analysis of the abstract, which outlines the main findings and implications of the study without delving into the specific methodologies used.",
