    "summary": "This research explores the concept of chronotopization as a framework for understanding how Iranian Azerbaijani migrants perceive and construct normative social behaviors in relation to time, space, and social interactions. The study posits that the various scales of 'chronotopes of normalcy' influence sociolinguistic behaviors and judgments among social actors. By analyzing participants' reflections on language choices, the research aims to demonstrate that these chronotopic frameworks can broaden the theoretical understanding of language use and apply to diverse sociolinguistic contexts beyond language selection.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the abstract by focusing on the main idea of the research, which is the introduction of the chronotopization concept and its implications for understanding normative social behavior and language use among Iranian Azerbaijani migrants. It emphasizes the dynamic nature of social behavior influenced by time and space, as well as the broader applicability of the findings to sociolinguistic phenomena. The reasoning clearly outlines how the summary reflects the core themes and findings of the research without delving into specific methodologies used.",
