    "summary": "This article analyzes the depiction of contraband slaves in Harper's Weekly and Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper during the Civil War. It discusses how these publications competed for readership by asserting the authenticity of their images and reports. The study reveals that early illustrations of African Americans relied on longstanding racial stereotypes, influenced by societal attitudes such as blackface minstrelsy and scientific racism. Over time, the visual representation of African Americans evolved significantly, particularly as emancipation progressed and the involvement of black Union soldiers increased, reflecting a shift in societal perceptions.",
