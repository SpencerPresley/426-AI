    "summary": "The abstract discusses the significant financial burden that rising textbook costs impose on students at American colleges, with prices having increased by 140% over the past two decades. This economic issue results in students having to prioritize their basic living expenses over purchasing textbooks, thus limiting their educational opportunities. The article presents a study that examines students' perceptions of Open/Alternative Educational Resources (OAER), particularly focusing on a nontraditional textbook used in a social work skills course. The findings suggest that students are generally open to the idea of purchasing a low-cost, nontraditional textbook, indicating a potential solution to alleviate their financial struggles related to educational materials.",
