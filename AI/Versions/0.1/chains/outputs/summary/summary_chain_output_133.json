    "summary": "This research investigates the internationalization strategies of Indian emerging market multinational corporations (EMNCs), focusing on their competencies, home country advantages, and specific practices that facilitate their entry into foreign markets. The study identifies a gap in the existing literature regarding the strategic practices of Indian firms in this context. Through a detailed examination of three Indian companies across various industries, the research reveals that these firms employ a mix of strategies, including strategic alliances, acquisitions, targeted geographic market entries, and innovative product offerings. The findings underscore the importance of combining these strategies with strong corporate governance to enhance successful internationalization. Ultimately, the study contributes valuable insights into the internationalization processes of EMNCs and offers a strategic roadmap for other firms from emerging markets seeking to expand globally.",
