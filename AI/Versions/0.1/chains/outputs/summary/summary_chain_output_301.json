    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of perceived job insecurity on sleep quality, highlighting its role as a significant stressor that can adversely affect both health and work performance. The study identifies negative work spillover as a mediating factor in this relationship and examines the potential moderating effect of gender, hypothesizing that men may experience a stronger connection between job insecurity and sleep quality than women. Through two studies involving diverse samples, the research confirms the mediating role of negative work spillover but finds no evidence of gender moderation in this relationship.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core focus of the research, which revolves around the consequences of perceived job insecurity on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved. It emphasizes the investigation of negative work spillover and the gender hypothesis, while also noting the results of the studies conducted. This approach ensures that the main ideas and implications of the research are clearly communicated without delving into the specific methodologies used.",
