    "summary": "This study investigates the temporal changes in soil microbial communities in newly constructed salt marshes, focusing on how these communities develop over time and respond to environmental conditions. The research reveals that while microbial diversity in the subsurface soils initially starts low, it increases to reference levels within three years, whereas surface soils maintain high diversity. The succession of microbial communities occurs fastest in the surface layers, taking about 24 years to reach natural conditions, while deeper layers change more slowly. Key microbial taxa associated with sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, and fermentation increase over time, indicating a shift towards natural marsh-like conditions. Notably, one marsh displayed a unique microbial composition linked to excessive inundation stress, suggesting that microbial community structure can serve as bioindicators of salt marsh health and may warrant further investigation.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main findings of the research, emphasizing the dynamics of soil microbial communities in relation to time and environmental stressors. It highlights the patterns of microbial diversity and the implications for understanding ecological health, without delving into the specific methodologies used in the study.",
