    "summary": "This research documents a rare instance of nest usurpation where a pair of Common Terns took over a nest belonging to Least Terns and brooded their chicks. Despite attempts by the Least Terns to care for their chicks, aggressive behavior from the Common Terns prevented any successful feeding, leading to the loss of all chicks, likely due to predation. The authors note that neither species was observed nesting before or after this incident, suggesting an atypical behavior pattern. They propose that such usurpation events may be more frequent than previously recognized and emphasize the need for enhanced monitoring methods to better understand the dynamics and causes of such interactions in bird species.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is the observation of a specific event of nest usurpation by Common Terns and its implications. It highlights the aggressive interactions between the two species, the outcomes for the chicks involved, and the broader significance of the findings in the context of avian behavior. The reasoning is based on the detailed account provided in the abstract, which outlines the behaviors observed and the conclusions drawn by the authors.",
