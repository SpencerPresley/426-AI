    "summary": "The research investigates the impact of clinical social work with trauma-exposed clients on social workers' mental health, particularly focusing on secondary traumatic stress, also known as compassion fatigue. It identifies various factors that contribute to the development of secondary trauma and assesses the role of self-care strategies in mitigating its effects. The study involved a sample of social workers who completed an online survey measuring their exposure to secondary trauma and coping mechanisms. Findings indicate that high levels of engagement in trauma-related work correlate with increased secondary trauma, while self-care practices can alleviate some of its negative impacts. The implications of these findings for education and workforce practices in social work are also discussed.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main focus of the research, which is the relationship between social work with trauma clients and the mental health of social workers. It highlights the identification of contributing factors to secondary trauma and the effectiveness of self-care strategies, while also mentioning the methodological aspect of the study without delving into specifics. This approach ensures that the summary remains centered on the research's contributions rather than its methods.",
