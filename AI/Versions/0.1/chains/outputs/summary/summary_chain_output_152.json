    "summary": "This research explores the ways in which patients communicate their pain experiences within the context of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). It highlights the importance of understanding how patient communication can influence both the psychological and physical aspects of pain. The study reveals that patients express their pain through an awareness of their interconnectedness with relational, physical, and physiological spaces. By fostering a therapeutic relationship that emphasizes this interdependence, CAM providers can enhance patients' ability to understand and accept their bodies, ultimately redefining their pain experiences.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main focus of the research, which is the exploration of patient communication regarding pain in the CAM context.
