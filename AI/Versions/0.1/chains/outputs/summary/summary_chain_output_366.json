    "summary": "This research investigates the effects of corporate label changes (CLC) on investor reactions, focusing on the roles of firm size and age. It utilizes a stakeholder approach to understand how these factors influence shareholder perceptions and responses to CLCs. The findings reveal that CLC does not significantly impact shareholder value, but larger and older firms tend to receive more favorable reactions. Additionally, the study highlights that the effect of firm size on investor reactions diminishes when firm performance is strong. The research also discusses practical implications for managers considering CLCs, emphasizing the need for careful evaluation due to potential risks and losses associated with such changes. Ultimately, the study fills a gap in the literature by centering on investor reactions as external stakeholders, offering valuable insights for corporate identity strategies.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main objective of the research, which is to explore how corporate label changes affect investor perceptions, particularly focusing on firm characteristics like size and age. It reflects the key findings and practical implications discussed in the abstract without delving into the specific methodologies used, thus adhering to the requirement of summarizing the main idea of the research rather than the methods employed.",
