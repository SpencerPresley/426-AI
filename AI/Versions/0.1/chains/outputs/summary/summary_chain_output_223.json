    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of store-in-store agreements, where retailers lease space to other retailers or brand manufacturers, on firm value. Despite their popularity in practice, there is limited academic insight into their effects. The study finds that these agreements generally increase firm value by an average of 1.06%. It further identifies that the effectiveness of these agreements is influenced by specific characteristics, such as partnering with dissimilar retailers that share a congruent brand image, and the reputation of the partner retailer. Retailers leasing space benefit from collaborating with reputable partners, while those renting space gain value by partnering with retailers that have a significant market presence.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main ideas of the research by focusing on the definition of store-in-store agreements, the gap in existing literature, the quantitative findings regarding firm value, and the specific characteristics that enhance this value.
