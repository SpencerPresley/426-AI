    "summary": "This research explores the dynamics of two-sided B2B electronic markets, focusing on how platform firms can utilize both formal and informal governance processes to manage transactions between buyers and sellers. The study hypothesizes that these governance processes impact seller performance, and it examines how structural attributes of the platform, such as self-participation and investments, moderate this relationship. Findings indicate that both governance processes enhance seller performance, but they interact differently with the moderators: self-participation boosts the effectiveness of procedural fairness while undermining monitoring, and investments have the opposite effect. The research concludes with practical recommendations for platform managers, suggesting tailored strategies to optimize participant performance.",
