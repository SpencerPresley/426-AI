    "summary": "This research investigates how firms strategically integrate alliances and acquisitions within the framework of exploration and exploitation. By analyzing a dataset of 1270 acquisitions from 836 firms, the study identifies five distinct patterns of behavior regarding alliances and acquisitions. The findings reveal that while some patterns exhibit a strong interplay between exploration and exploitation, others demonstrate a more segregated approach with a predominant focus on exploitation. This study enhances the understanding of how firms can effectively manage their strategic partnerships to balance innovation with operational efficiency.",
