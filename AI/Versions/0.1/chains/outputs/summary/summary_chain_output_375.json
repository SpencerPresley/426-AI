    "summary": "This research paper explores the concept of intersectionality, originally developed by Kimberle Williams Crenshaw in the late 1980s, emphasizing its application to individuals experiencing multiple forms of oppression, particularly Sikhs in the US and India. The author argues for the relevance of Crenshaw's intersectionality framework in understanding the unique challenges faced by Sikhs, who are considered multiply minoritized. Additionally, the paper introduces six theoretical formations that contribute to a deeper understanding of what the author terms 'intersectional Sikhism', which includes concepts such as intragroup solidarity and intellectual intersectionality.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main idea of the research, which revolves around applying the theory of intersectionality to the Sikh experience in the US and India, while also proposing new theoretical frameworks. It avoids specific methodologies, focusing instead on the core themes and contributions of the research.",
