    "summary": "This research paper investigates the competitive landscape of the quick service restaurant (QSR) industry, highlighting the challenges posed by proximity and customer switching behavior. It discusses how QSRs have traditionally innovated through menu changes and personalized experiences to enhance sales. However, the study identifies a less common strategy\u2014leveraging social media, specifically electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM)\u2014as a means to gain a competitive edge. The research explores the impact of geolocated social media messages on customer engagement and competitor visits, revealing that indirect social media interactions significantly influence customer behavior over a one-month period, with variations based on competitor density. Ultimately, the findings offer actionable insights for QSRs aiming to strengthen their market positions through effective social media use.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main themes and findings of the research without delving into specific methodologies. It focuses on the challenges faced by QSRs, the identified strategies for improvement, and the implications of social media engagement on customer behavior and competitive dynamics. This approach ensures that the essence of the research is communicated effectively, aligning with the abstract's intent.",
