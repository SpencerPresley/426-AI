    "summary": "The research investigates the factors influencing Chinese workers' attitudes toward labor strikes, particularly in multinational corporations (MNCs). It utilizes social exchange theory to analyze three types of relationships: employee-employer relations, labor-management relations, and leader-member relations. The findings indicate that negative perceptions in employee-employer relations are linked to more favorable attitudes toward strikes, while positive labor-management relations correlate with lower strike attitudes. Notably, leader-member relations do not significantly affect strike attitudes. The study concludes that avoiding negative interactions with employees is more critical for reducing strike attitudes than merely providing positive experiences.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research, focusing on the main findings regarding the relationship between social exchange dynamics and strike attitudes among Chinese workers. It emphasizes the significance of negative perceptions in employee-employer relations while also noting the contrasting effects of labor-management relations and the negligible impact of leader-member relations. This succinctly reflects the study's conclusions without delving into the specific methodologies employed.",
