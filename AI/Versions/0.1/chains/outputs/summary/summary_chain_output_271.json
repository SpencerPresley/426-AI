    "summary": "This research investigates the ecological impacts of the rapidly growing cage aquaculture for Nile tilapia in Lake Victoria, highlighting significant changes in the aquatic environment due to human activities. It notes the increase in tilapia fish cages from a minimal presence in 2012 to over 4,300 in 2018, indicating a substantial expansion of this industry. The study underscores the importance of monitoring these changes to assess environmental consequences effectively, as well as the need for proper management practices to mitigate negative impacts on the lake's ecology.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main idea of the research, which focuses on the ecological consequences of the expanding cage aquaculture industry in Lake Victoria. It emphasizes the dramatic increase in fish cages over time and the necessity for careful management to protect the lake's ecosystem. The summary avoids detailing specific methodologies, aligning with the requirement to focus on the research's main idea rather than the processes used.",
