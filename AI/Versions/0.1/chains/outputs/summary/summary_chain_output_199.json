    "summary": "This research investigates the factors influencing faculty engagement in higher education, particularly focusing on the role of faculty member grit and the relationships between faculty members and their academic chairs. The study develops and validates a model that posits a direct and indirect positive relationship between faculty member grit and engagement, with an emphasis on the leader-member exchange (LMX) between faculty and academic chairs. The findings indicate significant direct relationships between both faculty member grit and LMX with faculty engagement, while no indirect relationship through LMX was found. The paper discusses the implications of these results for higher education leaders and outlines limitations and future research directions.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main objective of the research, which is to explore the drivers of faculty engagement, specifically highlighting the importance of faculty grit and relationships with academic chairs. It captures the essence of the study's findings regarding the direct relationships identified and notes the absence of an indirect effect, which is crucial for understanding the dynamics of faculty engagement. Additionally, it addresses the implications for practice and future research, which are significant aspects of the abstract.",
