    "summary": "This paper investigates how firms can enhance their resilience to business risks arising from supply chain disruptions by developing big data analytics (BDA) capabilities. The authors explore the role of BDA in mediating the effects of institutional responses and information technology infrastructure capabilities (ITICs) on a firm's ability to build resilience against such disruptions. The study reveals that prior institutional experience with disruptions may negatively impact resilience, while adopting BDA capabilities can effectively leverage existing knowledge to improve resilience. Additionally, the research highlights that BDA not only enhances IT capabilities but also mediates the relationship between ITIC and resilience development. This study contributes to the literature by empirically validating the significance of BDA in fostering resilience, challenging the conventional view that past experience prepares organizations for future disruptions.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main objectives and findings of the research without delving into specific methodologies. It highlights the core focus on BDA capabilities and their impact on resilience against supply chain disruptions, as well as the contrasting findings regarding institutional experience. This approach ensures that the essence of the study is captured while avoiding methodological specifics, fulfilling the requirement of focusing on the main idea of the research.",
