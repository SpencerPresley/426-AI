    "summary": "This research paper investigates the institutional responses within academia to the phenomena of supermobility and superdiversity, highlighting how political and economic pressures have transformed the landscape of academic employment. It reveals that the increasing prevalence of temporary job labels has emerged as a response to tightening job markets and political populism, positioning these temporary roles as the primary option for job seekers in a competitive academic environment. The study critically examines the language used in job advertisements, showing how euphemistic discourse is employed to obscure the realities of temporary work and how nationality criteria are utilized to justify exclusionary practices in academic spaces. Ultimately, the research challenges the notion of open borders for academics, indicating that new linguistic trends reflect a growing sentiment against mobility and diversity in intellectual circles.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core themes of the research, focusing on the institutional pushbacks against supermobility and superdiversity, the evolving nature of job labels in academia, and the implications of language in perpetuating exclusionary practices. It avoids delving into specific methodologies, instead providing a cohesive overview of the research's contributions and findings.",
