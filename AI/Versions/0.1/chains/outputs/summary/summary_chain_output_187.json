    "summary": "This research explores the use of social media platforms as a potentially cost-effective method for collecting stated preference data. It examines how willingness to pay (WTP) for increased cultural and recreational use of an ecologically unique site varies between a representative sample and a convenience sample. The findings indicate mixed results regarding the differences in WTP estimates across these groups, influenced by specific survey attributes. The study emphasizes the need for caution in generalizing results from convenience samples to the broader population, highlighting the importance of correcting for sample selection bias.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is the investigation of WTP differences between two sampling groups using social media for data collection. It also reflects the findings and the caution advised by the researchers regarding the generalizability of the results. This encapsulates the essence of the abstract without delving into the specific methodologies used.",
