    "summary": "This study investigates the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) detection methods to monitor the invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas) in estuarine environments. It assesses how various life stages of the crabs affect eDNA detection rates. Initial field experiments found no detectable eDNA in sediment samples, while laboratory trials revealed that eDNA was present in all tested aquaria, albeit at low concentrations for non-ovigerous crabs. The research highlights the significance of considering life stage and sampling methods in monitoring efforts for crustaceans in dynamic environments.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research, focusing on the application of eDNA methods for monitoring an invasive species and the influence of life stages on detection rates. It synthesizes the main findings without delving into specific methodologies, which aligns with the requirement to focus on the main idea of the research.",
