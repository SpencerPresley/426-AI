    "summary": "This research explores how mobile money (MM) influences the resilience and business outcomes of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries during the Covid-19 pandemic. It highlights a significant gap in existing evidence regarding the benefits of MM for SMEs, despite its potential to enhance their resilience. The findings indicate that SMEs are more vulnerable to severe sales declines compared to larger firms. However, the study suggests that integrating MM into daily operations can mitigate these adverse effects. The research emphasizes the importance of incorporating digital technologies into policy responses to effectively address the challenges posed by the pandemic.",
