    "summary": "This research investigates how wild elephants navigate their environment, particularly focusing on their use of habitual routes compared to Euclidean paths when revisiting resource sites. The study reveals that elephants exhibit flexibility in their navigation strategies, adapting their methods based on their familiarity with different areas within their home range. In familiar regions, they tend to utilize direct routes, while in less familiar areas, they shift to habitual routes. The findings indicate that this behavior is similar to navigation strategies observed in smaller mammals and highlights the significance of route intersections in decision-making during navigation, suggesting that these intersections contribute to the elephants' understanding of their spatial environment.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research, emphasizing the elephants' navigation strategies and their adaptability based on familiarity with their surroundings. It avoids mentioning specific methodologies, focusing instead on the findings and implications of the study. The reasoning reflects an understanding of the abstract's core themes, including the importance of habitual routes and intersections in navigation.",
