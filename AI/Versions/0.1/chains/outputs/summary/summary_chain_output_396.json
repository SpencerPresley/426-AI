    "summary": "The research investigates how companies can improve their Risk Management Infrastructure (RMI) by integrating Big Data Analytics (BDA) to enhance their ability to manage risks effectively. The study develops a theoretical framework and tests the hypothesis that BDA capabilities positively influence the relationship between RMI and risk resilience, ultimately leading to a more effective risk management strategy for firms.",
    "reasoning": "This summary encapsulates the main focus of the research, which is the relationship between BDA and RMI in enhancing risk resilience. It highlights the development of a theoretical model and the testing of hypotheses without detailing the specific methodologies employed, thus adhering to the requirement of focusing on the main idea rather than the methods used.",
