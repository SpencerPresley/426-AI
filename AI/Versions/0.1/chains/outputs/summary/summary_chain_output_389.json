    "summary": "This article explores the concept of 'the contemporary' in art theory, focusing on the distinctions between contemporary music and contemporary art. It discusses how contemporary art has evolved from historical avant-garde movements into a post-conceptual form that emphasizes meaning and social processes, while contemporary music remains tied to aesthetic modernism and faces identity challenges. The article also examines sound art and its conflicts with contemporary art's characteristics. The author argues that neither sound art nor contemporary music truly aligns with the historical definition of 'contemporary' in art theory. To address this, the author proposes a new category called 'musical contemporary art' to better define practices that diverge significantly from traditional contemporary music and sound art.",
