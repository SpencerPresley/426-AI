    "summary": "This study investigates how the actual expertise and social status of team members influence their ability to affect team processes through perceived expertise. It examines the conditions under which teams prefer perceived expertise over social status in their influence dynamics. The authors propose a contingency model that links the significance of expertise and social status to different types of intragroup conflicts. The research, based on multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams, reveals that both actual expertise and social status directly and indirectly affect influence through perceived expertise. Notably, social status is more influential in the early stages of projects, while actual expertise becomes more dominant later. The findings also indicate that perceived experts are particularly influential in contexts of high task conflict or low relationship conflict, highlighting practical implications for team dynamics and management.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the main focus on the interplay between actual expertise, social status, and perceived expertise within team dynamics. It emphasizes the development of a contingency model and the empirical findings derived from the survey data, providing a clear picture of how these factors interact across different contexts of intragroup conflict. The reasoning is rooted in the abstract's structure, which delineates the objectives, methods, and key findings, ensuring a comprehensive yet concise representation of the research.",
