    "summary": "This research investigates the necessity of interfirm dynamic capabilities for healthcare organizations to effectively respond to changes in supply chains within a volatile environment. It highlights the existing gap in literature regarding interfirm dynamic capabilities, particularly in the healthcare sector. By proposing a framework that categorizes these capabilities into five dimensions\u2014sensing, learning, coordination, collective mind, and partner development\u2014the study aims to enhance understanding of how these capabilities can improve hospital performance. The findings indicate that aligning a healthcare delivery network's dynamic capabilities with its information processing needs can significantly enhance operational effectiveness and overall performance.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main idea of the research, focusing on the role of interfirm dynamic capabilities in healthcare organizations. It emphasizes the gap in existing literature, the proposed framework for understanding these capabilities, and the implications of the findings for improving hospital performance. This approach avoids detailing specific methodologies, aligning with the requirement to concentrate on the research's main idea rather than the methods used.",
