    "summary": "This research paper investigates the influence of gender and marital status on homeownership in urban China. It explores how these factors, along with other determinants, affect homeownership rates among different demographic groups, particularly focusing on the differences between never married women and men. The findings reveal that never married individuals are generally less likely to own homes compared to married couples, with never married women facing lower homeownership rates than their male counterparts. The study highlights the varying personal characteristics that impact homeownership differently for these groups and suggests the need for further research tailored to never married individuals to better understand these dynamics.",
