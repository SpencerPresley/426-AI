    "summary": "The research describes a structured three-part laboratory experiment aimed at enhancing students' understanding of the Buchwald-Hartwig amination reaction through guided inquiry. The experiment emphasizes active learning, where students first engage with fundamental concepts, then apply their knowledge to conduct a larger-scale reaction, and finally purify and characterize the products. This experiment serves as a significant capstone experience in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum, integrating theoretical knowledge with practical laboratory skills.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main objective of the research, which is to provide a comprehensive learning experience for students through a structured laboratory experiment. It highlights the educational approach of guided inquiry and the progression of activities designed to deepen understanding and application of chemical concepts, without delving into specific methodologies used in the experiment.",
