    "summary": "This research explores how consumers' perceptions of price fairness are influenced by the efforts of other consumers, particularly in the context of differing prices for the same product. It identifies a gap in existing literature regarding the cognitive and emotional processes that underpin these judgments. The authors propose two studies to investigate how the efforts of referent consumers can alleviate feelings of unfairness when prices vary. Their findings support a dual-process model, indicating that such efforts can reduce buyer anger and enhance understanding of price differences, thereby mitigating perceived unfairness.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core focus of the research, which is the relationship between consumer efforts and price fairness perceptions. It highlights the gaps in existing research that the study aims to address and summarizes the key findings related to the dual-process model. This provides a clear understanding of the main idea without delving into specific methodologies used.",
