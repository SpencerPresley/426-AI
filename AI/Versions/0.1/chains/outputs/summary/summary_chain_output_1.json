    "summary": "This research paper examines the impact of deregulating foreign equity ownership on innovation investments by firms, specifically focusing on 530 Korean manufacturing firms from 1998 to 2003. The findings indicate a complex, inverted U-shaped relationship between foreign ownership and research and development (R&D) investment, where initial increases in foreign ownership enhance investment, but this effect diminishes as ownership becomes more concentrated. Furthermore, the study explores how firm characteristics, such as age and growth opportunities, moderate this relationship, revealing that older firms negatively affect innovation investment while firms with greater growth opportunities positively influence it. Overall, the research highlights the intricate dynamics between foreign ownership and innovation investment, influenced by various firm-specific factors.",
