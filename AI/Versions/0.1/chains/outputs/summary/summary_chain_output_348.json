    "summary": "The research explores the surprising relationship between Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Herbert Hoover, emphasizing the complexities that challenge the notion of a cohesive 'Presidents Club.' It argues that there are no fixed rules governing presidential behavior, as illustrated by Trump's criticisms of former presidents. The paper highlights how Johnson and Hoover's collaboration was shaped by personal, political, and institutional factors, including their shared backgrounds and commitment to aiding the poor. Their interactions were intertwined with issues of legacy and bipartisanship, with Hoover seeking relevance and Johnson aiming to elevate his image by honoring Hoover. Ultimately, both presidents did not fully achieve their goals through this association.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the unexpected nature of the Johnson-Hoover relationship and the various factors influencing it. It reflects the main themes of complexity in presidential interactions, the lack of established norms, and the personal motivations behind their collaboration. By focusing on the overarching narrative rather than specific methods, the summary aligns with the requirement to encapsulate the main idea of the research.",
