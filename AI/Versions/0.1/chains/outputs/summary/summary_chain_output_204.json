    "summary": "This research investigates how the core competencies of enterprises impact the maturity of their IT applications (ITAM). It considers the roles of management capabilities, firm ownership structures, and ISO certifications in this relationship. The study finds that stronger management institutional capabilities correlate positively with ITAM, particularly in state-owned enterprises, while process management capabilities are more significant in multinational companies. Additionally, ISO certifications assist companies with weaker management capabilities in enhancing ITAM, but they may also lessen the importance of management capabilities for firms with stronger institutional capabilities, shifting the focus to process management.",
