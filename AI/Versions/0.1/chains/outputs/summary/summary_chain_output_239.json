    "summary": "This research investigates the effects of diabetes-induced hyperglycemia on peripheral nerve structure using zebrafish as a model organism. It highlights that hyperglycemia is linked to various complications, particularly diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), which affects a significant portion of diabetes patients. The study demonstrates that prolonged hyperglycemia leads to notable structural changes in peripheral nerves, including disruptions in axon formation and myelination. By employing zebrafish, the research not only provides insights into the mechanisms underlying nerve dysfunction due to hyperglycemia but also suggests the potential for this model in future drug discovery efforts targeting DPN.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the abstract by focusing on the main findings regarding the impact of hyperglycemia on nerve structure and the implications for understanding diabetic complications. It avoids detailing specific methodologies, instead emphasizing the significance of using zebrafish as a model for this research, which is a key theme throughout the abstract.",
