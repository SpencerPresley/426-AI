    "summary": "This research explores the communication systems of female tungara frogs and fringelipped bats, focusing on the use of various signals to locate male frogs. It highlights the role of acoustic signals, alongside additional cues such as vocal sac inflation and water ripples, in enhancing detection and decision-making. The study identifies a lack of understanding regarding the natural variation and interrelationships among these signals. Through detailed recordings of calling males, the authors reveal significant correlations among the measured components and demonstrate that multimodal models provide better predictions of male body mass than unimodal models. The findings underscore the interconnectedness of communication components and pave the way for future research on how receivers interpret complex signals.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main idea of the research by focusing on the communication systems of the species studied, the significance of various signals, and the findings regarding their interrelationships and predictive capabilities. It avoids detailing the specific methods used, instead emphasizing the implications of the results and their relevance to future studies.",
