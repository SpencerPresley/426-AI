    "summary": "This research introduces a new numerical method for valuing American options using the Heston model. The method simplifies the valuation process by separating the stock price and volatility processes, which enhances computational efficiency. The authors validate their approach through numerical results that demonstrate its accuracy and compare it with existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in financial mathematics.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the introduction of a new numerical method, its simplification of the valuation process, and the validation through numerical results. It avoids specific details about the methodologies used, instead emphasizing the main contributions and findings of the research.",
