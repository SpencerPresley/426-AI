    "summary": "This research explores the concept of temporality within Ayurvedic protocols for managing chronic pain, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of how time is perceived and utilized in treatment. It identifies a gap in current pain research regarding the management of temporal dynamics, despite their recognized importance. Through interviews with Ayurvedic physicians, the study reveals that temporality is conceptualized as spatiotemporal present moment awareness (PMA) and embodied time (ET). PMA refers to the cognitive awareness of time's relational aspects and their physiological implications, while ET encompasses emotional and psychosocial experiences of time. The findings propose a framework that positions spatiotemporality as a crucial organizing principle in chronic pain management, distinguishing it from traditional notions of temporality.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research by highlighting the exploration of temporality in Ayurvedic practices for chronic pain management. It synthesizes the key findings regarding how Ayurvedic protocols conceptualize time, which is central to the study, without delving into the specific methodologies used. The summary also addresses the identified gap in pain research, providing a coherent overview of the study's significance and contributions.",
