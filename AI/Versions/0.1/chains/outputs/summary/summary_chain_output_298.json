    "summary": "This study investigates how empathy towards a hypothetical rape victim and rapist varies according to individuals' experiences of sexual victimization and perpetration, as well as their gender. A sample of 531 undergraduates was categorized into four groups based on their sexual aggression experiences: nonexperienced, victimization-only, perpetration-only, and overlapping experiences. Findings indicate that those with victimization-only experience exhibit significantly greater empathy towards rape victims compared to those with overlapping or no experiences. Additionally, women showed higher empathy for victims and lower empathy for perpetrators than men. The study suggests that individuals with overlapping experiences may struggle to empathize with rape victims as effectively as those with victimization-only experience, and calls for future research to treat overlapping experiences as a distinct category.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core aim of the research, which is to explore the relationship between empathy and experiences of sexual aggression, highlighting the differences based on victimization and perpetration experiences, as well as gender. It synthesizes the key findings without delving into specific methodologies used, maintaining focus on the implications of the study's results.",
