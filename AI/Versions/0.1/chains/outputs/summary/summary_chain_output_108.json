    "summary": "This research explores the effects of motion in online advertising, specifically how different types of animated imagery influence emotional arousal in consumers. It highlights that while motion is increasingly used in digital ads, understanding its impact remains limited. The study introduces the dynamic default hypothesis, which suggests that animated images should elicit more arousal than static images. However, it also addresses inconsistencies in existing research findings and proposes the behavioral urgency hypothesis to explain these discrepancies, suggesting that not all types of motion have the same effect on arousal. The authors conducted experiments that revealed imagery that appears to loom closer to viewers generates greater arousal compared to static images or those that seem to recede. Additionally, the research identifies the moderating role of lay rationalism in influencing these effects. Overall, the findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how dynamic imagery affects consumer responses in advertising.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is the investigation of how different types of motion in advertising impact emotional arousal. It integrates the key hypotheses presented in the abstract, the findings from the experiments, and the implications of these findings for existing literature. This approach ensures that the essence of the research is conveyed without delving into specific methodologies used in the study.",
