    "summary": "This research addresses the complexities of adolescent sexual identity, highlighting the inadequacies of existing measurement tools in capturing the diversity of contemporary identities. By analyzing a substantial dataset of sexual minority adolescents aged 14-17 in the United States, the study proposes a new taxonomy of eight sexual identity categories. The findings reveal significant differences in sexual identification based on various factors, including age and assigned sex at birth, while indicating that adolescents with less common sexual identities face greater mental health risks. The authors advocate for the adoption of their proposed taxonomy in future research to enhance the understanding and measurement of adolescent sexual identities.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main objectives and findings of the research without delving into the specific methodologies employed. It emphasizes the need for improved measurement tools and the implications of the findings for mental health among adolescents, which are central themes of the abstract.",
