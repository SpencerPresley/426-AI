    "summary": "This study investigates how managers' perceptions of employees' organizational commitment influence their assessments of career growth opportunities for those employees. The findings reveal that managers interpret positive employee behaviors, such as strong extra-role performance and increased work engagement, as indicators of employees' commitment to the organization. Consequently, employees viewed as highly committed enjoy better career growth opportunities. Furthermore, the relationship between managers' perceptions of employees' commitment and their career growth is more pronounced for those employees who are also seen as committed to their own careers.",
