    "summary": "This research investigates the motivations behind firms' voluntary adoption of green management practices in response to societal pressures for environmental protection. It highlights that firms often go beyond legal requirements and may not achieve immediate financial benefits from these practices. The study suggests that firms outperforming their peers tend to become more risk-seeking to avoid losing their competitive advantage, which leads them to engage more actively in stakeholder management through green initiatives. Specifically, the research examines the Green Power Partnership (GPP), a program encouraging firms to purchase green power. The findings indicate that firms exceeding social performance expectations are likely to increase their green power usage, while those with related diversification show less motivation to adopt such practices.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core focus of the research, which is the exploration of firms' motivations for adopting green practices, particularly in relation to their performance and risk behavior. It reflects the key themes presented in the abstract without delving into specific methodologies, thus adhering to the requirements of summarizing the main idea of the research.",
