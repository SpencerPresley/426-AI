    "summary": "This research investigates the influence of internationalization on the performance of family firms, highlighting a significant positive correlation. It also examines how various moderators, including family ownership levels and cultural factors, affect this relationship. The findings suggest that family firms with lower family ownership benefit more from internationalization, and cultural elements like individualism and masculinity enhance this positive effect. The authors discuss practical and theoretical implications of these results and propose directions for future research.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core focus of the research, which is the relationship between internationalization and family firm performance, while addressing the role of moderators. It synthesizes the key findings and implications without delving into specific methodologies used in the analysis, thus maintaining the integrity of the abstract's main idea.",
