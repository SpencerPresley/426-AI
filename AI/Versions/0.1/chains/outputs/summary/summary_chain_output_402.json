    "summary": "This research investigates the relationship between emotional intelligence and workplace behaviors, specifically organizational citizenship behavior and counterproductive work behavior, across various cultural contexts. It finds that the connection between emotional intelligence and organizational citizenship behavior is particularly strong in cultures that are long-term oriented and exhibit restraint. However, this relationship remains consistent across different cultural dimensions, such as individualism versus collectivism and masculinity versus femininity. In contrast, the link between emotional intelligence and counterproductive work behavior is stronger in collectivistic and feminine cultures, as well as in cultures characterized by high levels of uncertainty avoidance and power distance. The study also highlights that both positive and negative emotional states mediate these relationships. It recommends that human resource professionals in cultures where emotional intelligence has a stronger impact should focus on hiring emotionally intelligent employees and providing training to enhance emotional intelligence, thereby promoting positive workplace behaviors and reducing negative ones, despite cultural differences.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main findings and implications of the research without delving into the specific methods used. It emphasizes the relevance of emotional intelligence in different cultural contexts and its effects on workplace behaviors, which is the core focus of the study. The reasoning behind the summary is based on the identified relationships and recommendations provided in the abstract, ensuring that the essence of the research is conveyed clearly and concisely.",
