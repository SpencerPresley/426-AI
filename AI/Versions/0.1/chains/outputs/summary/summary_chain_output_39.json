    "summary": "This study investigates the differences in firmness between used mattress coil springs located in areas that bear the most weight and those that experience minimal compression. The findings reveal that weight-bearing springs are significantly weaker under load compared to non-weightbearing springs. This structural weakness may not be visually detectable when the mattress is not in use, suggesting that coil springs could eventually fail to provide adequate support, which may lead to poor sleep quality and posture over time.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the primary focus on comparing the firmness of different types of mattress springs and the implications of these findings on mattress performance and sleep quality. It avoids detailing the specific methodologies, instead focusing on the core outcomes and their significance.",
