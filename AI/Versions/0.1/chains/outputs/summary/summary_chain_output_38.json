    "summary": "The research introduces the Integrated Capacious Model of Leadership Identities Construction (ICM), which serves as a comprehensive framework for understanding leader identity. This model synthesizes various existing theories and contextual elements that influence leader identity, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary and multi-level approaches. The ICM identifies key systems and influences that shape leader identities over time and space, highlighting that leader identity is a construct influenced by various factors rather than just individual instances. Additionally, the model has practical applications, such as serving as a diagnostic tool for leader identity construction and informing the design of leader development programs.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the development of the ICM as a framework for understanding leader identity. It highlights the integration of existing theories and contextual influences, the emphasis on a broader perspective of leader identity, and the practical applications of the model. This aligns with the abstract's main themes without delving into specific methodologies, which is crucial for maintaining a high-level overview.",
    "feedback": {
        "methodologies_feedback": "The methodologies identified were relevant and aligned with the abstract's content. However, the term 'diagnostic tool' could be further clarified in terms of its specific applications within the ICM framework. A more explicit connection between the methodologies and their practical implications would enhance understanding.",
        "abstract_sentence_analysis_feedback": "The sentence-level analysis was thorough and accurately captured the meanings and context of each sentence. However, a more concise summarization of the overall theme could improve clarity. Additionally, emphasizing the practical applications of the ICM could provide a stronger link to the research's implications."
