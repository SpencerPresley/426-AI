    "summary": "This study investigates the relationship between financial well-being\u2014both objective and subjective\u2014and depression symptoms among older adults in China, emphasizing the role of family financial support.

Additionally, perceived difficulty in money management is linked to higher levels of depression. The research highlights the importance of financial well-being in mental health and suggests that public policies should be developed to enhance financial and mental health services for the elderly in China.",
