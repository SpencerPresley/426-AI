    "summary": "This study investigates the role of resilience in reducing student dropout rates in accounting programs by evaluating its effectiveness as a coping strategy. The research involved a sample of 443 accounting majors from four U.S. universities and examined how resilience interacts with role stressors, psychological health, and burnout to influence students' intentions to leave the major. The findings suggest that resilience positively impacts psychological health and negatively affects burnout, thereby reducing the likelihood of students departing from the accounting major. Overall, the study emphasizes the importance of fostering resilience among students to enhance their retention in academic programs.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the main goal, which is to evaluate resilience as a coping strategy to mitigate student departure from the accounting major. It outlines the context of the study, including the sample size and the relationship between resilience and other psychological factors. The reasoning behind the summary is based on the core findings presented in the abstract, highlighting the positive effects of resilience on psychological health and its indirect influence on retention rates.",
    "feedback": {
        "methodologies_feedback": "The methodologies extracted were relevant and accurately identified the key processes involved in the research. However, it would be beneficial to include more context around how the psychometric instruments specifically relate to measuring resilience, as this could enhance understanding of their role in the study. Additionally, clarifying the types of data analysis performed could provide further insight into the research methodology.",
        "abstract_sentence_analysis_feedback": "The analysis of each sentence was thorough and provided clear meanings and reasoning. However, some sentences could benefit from a more explicit connection to how they contribute to the overall findings of the study. For instance, explicitly linking the negative associations found with role stressors to the conclusions about resilience would strengthen the analysis. Overall, the analysis is well-structured, but enhancing the connections between individual sentence meanings and the overarching themes could improve clarity."
