    "summary": "This research investigates the conflict between corporate disclosures and actual practices, specifically focusing on the interaction of tax avoidance and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and their effects on economic outcomes. The study evaluates how investor perceptions are influenced when these corporate behaviors are at odds, revealing that tax avoidance generally has a negative impact on investment decisions. Although CSR alone does not directly affect these decisions, its presence can mitigate the adverse effects of tax avoidance. The findings indicate that a firm's policies regarding CSR and tax avoidance lead to varied investment intentions, significantly shaped by individual ethical beliefs. Ultimately, promoting stakeholder values can help companies shield themselves from the negative repercussions associated with tax avoidance, illustrating the important role of personal attitudes in interpreting corporate behaviors.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by highlighting the main focus on the conflict between tax avoidance and CSR, the impact on investor perceptions, and the overall implications for corporate policies and individual attitudes. It synthesizes the key points without delving into specific methodologies, thus adhering to the requirement of focusing on the main ideas rather than the methods used.",
    "feedback": {
        "methodologies_feedback": "The methodologies identified were relevant and accurately reflected the processes described in the abstract. However, it would be beneficial to ensure that the methods are clearly distinguished from the outcomes or findings to avoid any potential confusion in the summary process. Additionally, providing more context on how these methods contribute to the overall understanding of the research could enhance clarity.",
        "abstract_sentence_analysis_feedback": "The sentence-level analysis was thorough and provided clear meanings and reasonings for each segment of the abstract. However, it could be improved by ensuring that the connections between sentences are more explicitly stated, which would help in understanding the flow of the research narrative. This would facilitate a smoother synthesis of the ideas when forming a summary."
