    "summary": "This research examines the impact of regulatory growth on small versus large businesses, finding that increased regulations disproportionately affect small firms, leading to a reduction in their numbers and employment levels. Specifically, a 10% increase in regulatory restrictions correlates with a 0.5% decrease in the total number of firms, but small businesses experience a 0.6% decrease in employment. The study also reveals that prolonged regulatory growth exacerbates these negative effects on small firms without similarly impacting large firms. Interestingly, larger firms show lower job destruction rates in the face of rising regulations. These findings align with the Public Choice theory, suggesting that regulatory growth is detrimental to small businesses while minimally affecting larger competitors.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the core findings and implications of the research, focusing on the comparative effects of regulatory growth on small and large businesses. It synthesizes the key quantitative results and contextualizes them within the framework of the Public Choice theory, which is essential for understanding the theoretical implications of the study.",
