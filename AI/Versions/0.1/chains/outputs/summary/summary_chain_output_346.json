    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of astronomy clubs and summer camps on elementary students' perceptions of scientists over a five-year period. Using draw-a-scientist tests (DASTs) administered before and after the programs, the study aims to identify changes in students' conceptions of scientists. Analysis of 89 pairs of DASTs reveals a significant gender imbalance, with a low percentage of students drawing female scientists, and highlights the prevalence of stereotypical appearances and activities among the drawn scientists. Despite minimal changes in most categories, there is an increase in stereotypical appearances and a notable decrease in stereotypical activities, prompting suggestions for improving the assessment methods used in future research.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the main objective, which is to understand how astronomy-related activities influence students' views of scientists. It highlights key findings such as gender representation and stereotypes, while also mentioning the methods of data collection and analysis without delving into specific methodologies, thus maintaining a focus on the research outcomes and implications.",
