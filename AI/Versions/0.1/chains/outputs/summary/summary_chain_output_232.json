    "summary": "This research explores the connections between software vendors and the risks that software vulnerabilities pose to application security. By analyzing data from the China National Vulnerability Database, the study categorizes software vendors into three distinct groups and examines how the relationships between software vulnerabilities and application security risks differ across these categories. The findings indicate that these relationships are not uniform, suggesting that software vendors should tailor their understanding of vulnerabilities based on their specific category to prevent the emergence of new vulnerabilities in their products.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the main focus of the research, which is the relationship between software vendor types and their associated security risks due to vulnerabilities. It highlights the use of data from a specific source, the categorization of vendors, and the implications of the findings without delving into the specific methodologies employed. This approach ensures that the summary remains focused on the overarching research themes rather than the details of the methods used.",
