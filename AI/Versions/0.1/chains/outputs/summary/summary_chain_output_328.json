    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of different types of nonaudit services (NAS)\u2014specifically audit-related, tax, and other services\u2014on the perceived independence of auditors, particularly in the context of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). It critiques previous studies for their reliance on aggregate measures of NAS and demonstrates that these aggregate measures do not significantly affect investor responses to earnings announcements. The findings reveal that while audit-related NAS is viewed negatively by investors, tax-related NAS is perceived positively, leading to an overall neutral perception when considered together. The study also highlights that the effects are more pronounced in firms with high accruals and smaller firms, and suggests that existing measures of financial dependence do not adequately explain the influence of NAS on investor perceptions. Furthermore, the positive perception of tax NAS is linked to its impact on a firm's tax strategies.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the primary focus of the research, which is to analyze how various types of NAS affect investor perceptions of auditor independence. It emphasizes the critique of prior research, highlights the main findings regarding investor perceptions, and notes the implications of these findings for firms of different sizes and financial characteristics. By avoiding specifics of the methodologies used, the summary maintains a focus on the overarching conclusions and significance of the study.",
