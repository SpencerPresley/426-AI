    "summary": "This research paper investigates the relationship between startup regulations and institutional quality on new business activity across 119 countries from 2001 to 2012. The findings indicate that countries with high barriers to entry and low-quality governmental institutions experience significantly lower rates of new business creation. Specifically, for every additional step required to start a business, entrepreneurial activity decreases by 3% to 7%. Conversely, enhancing the average quality of institutions by one standard deviation is associated with a 34% increase in new business activity. Overall, the study emphasizes the critical role of regulatory and institutional environments in fostering entrepreneurship.",
