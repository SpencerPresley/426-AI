    "summary": "This research investigates the important yet often neglected role of healthcare providers' bodies in the provider-patient relationship, particularly focusing on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners. Through interviews with CAM providers, the study reveals how their self-awareness of bodily experiences, including illness and faith, shapes their understanding and interaction with patients. It emphasizes the embodied nature of the provider-patient relationship, highlighting that both parties collaboratively construct therapeutic goals. The findings advocate for integrating providers' self-reflexive awareness into patient-centered care, suggesting that this can enhance the healthcare experience for both patients and providers.",
    "reasoning": "The summary encapsulates the core focus of the research, which is the significance of providers' physical presence and self-awareness in enhancing the provider-patient relationship. It highlights the methodology of conducting interviews, the findings regarding the mutual influence of provider and patient experiences, and the implications for patient-centered healthcare. The reasoning reflects the main themes presented in the abstract without delving into specific methodologies, thus aligning with the requirement to focus on the research's main idea.",
