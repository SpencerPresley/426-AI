    "summary": "This article explores the efforts to validate physiocratic principles in eighteenth-century Baden, focusing on the concept of net yield, a surplus derived primarily from agriculture. The physiocrats proposed a new framework linking economic prosperity to moral welfare. Despite claims of self-evidence, their ideas faced significant criticism, leading to trials that aimed to provide practical demonstrations to convince skeptics. Although these efforts were ultimately seen as unsuccessful, they highlighted the role of experimental practices in shaping beliefs during the period, influencing areas beyond just natural sciences.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main ideas of the research by outlining the historical context (eighteenth-century Baden), the central concept (net yield), the intended contributions of physiocracy (linking economics and moral welfare), the criticisms faced, and the significance of the trials conducted. It emphasizes the interplay between theory and practical demonstration, as well as the broader implications of these efforts in shaping convictions beyond the natural sciences.",
