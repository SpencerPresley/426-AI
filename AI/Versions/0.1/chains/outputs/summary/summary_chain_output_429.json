    "summary": "This study investigates the effects of recent rape experiences on body-esteem and self-esteem among undergraduate women. It compares the psychological outcomes of women who have experienced rape recently versus those who experienced it earlier and nonvictims. The findings indicate that women who were raped within the past year reported significantly lower levels of both body-esteem and self-esteem compared to those who were raped more than a year ago and nonvictims, while earlier victims showed no significant differences from nonvictims. Additionally, the labeling of the rape experience did not significantly impact self-esteem or body-esteem levels. The research highlights the correlation between recent rape and diminished self-perception in terms of body-esteem and self-esteem.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main focus of the research, which is to examine the psychological effects of recent rape experiences on body-esteem and self-esteem.
