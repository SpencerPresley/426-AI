    "summary": "This research examines the established positive relationship between leader behavioral integrity and employee in-role performance, while exploring the underlying mechanisms that explain this relationship. The authors utilize two theoretical frameworks to clarify how leader behavioral integrity influences employee performance and identify conditions that affect this influence. The study highlights the mediating role of coworker support in the relationship between leader integrity and employee autonomy, revealing that this effect is stronger for employees who perceive higher job autonomy. Ultimately, the findings suggest that both a leader's integrity and job resources play crucial roles in fostering supportive team dynamics that enhance employee performance. The implications of these findings for theory and practice are also discussed.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research by focusing on the relationship between leader behavioral integrity and employee performance, the mediating role of coworker support, and the importance of job autonomy. It avoids specific methodological details, instead emphasizing the theoretical frameworks and implications of the findings. This aligns with the goal of summarizing the abstract without delving into the methods used in the study.",
