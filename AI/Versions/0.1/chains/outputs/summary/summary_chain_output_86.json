    "summary": "This research paper explores the critical role of leadership in guiding organizations through the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the context of emerging economies like India. It highlights how businesses are increasingly recognized for their contributions to economic development and examines the responses of Indian companies to the pandemic. The study identifies specific strategies adopted by organizational leaders, who initially felt overwhelmed but ultimately combined prudent (immediate survival actions) and bold (long-term growth strategies) approaches to navigate the crisis. The findings underscore the dynamic relationships between leadership practices, risk management, and performance outcomes across multiple case studies involving multinational enterprises from various industries.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the essence of the research by focusing on the main themes of leadership, organizational responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implications for economic development in emerging economies. It synthesizes the findings and significance of the study without delving into the specific methodologies used, which aligns with the requirement to focus on the research's main ideas rather than the methods.",
