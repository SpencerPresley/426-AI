        "reasoning": "Structural equation modeling is a statistical technique used to analyze the relationships between C. guttata and other turtles, allowing for the investigation of direct interactions versus environmental influences.",
        "passages": [
            "We used structural equation modeling to better understand if the relationships between C. guttata and other turtles were due to direct interactions or simply reflected environmental influences."

        "reasoning": "Stable isotope analyses are used to compare dietary overlap between species by examining isotopic ratios, providing a specific methodological approach to assess resource competition.",
        "passages": [
            "We then used stable isotope analyses to compare similarities in delta C-13 and delta N-15 isotopes as proxies for diet overlap between C. guttata and other turtles."
