        "reasoning": "Variable distance analysis refers to the method of studying how the song structure of female birds changes or remains constant when sung over different distances, which is an important aspect of the research.",

            "Additionally, we examined the song structure of within-pair communication songs at variable distances between mates and between neighbour females.",
