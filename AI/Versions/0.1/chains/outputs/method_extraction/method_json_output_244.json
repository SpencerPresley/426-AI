        "reasoning": "Field experiments involve testing insecticides in a natural setting to observe their effects on ant behavior, which is a critical part of the research methodology.",
        "passages": [
            "Similarly, these insecticides significantly triggered the particle-covering behavior of ants in the field."

        "reasoning": "Hypothesis testing is a method used to evaluate the proposed idea that particle-covering behavior reduces insecticide toxicity, which is a fundamental aspect of scientific inquiry in this research.",
