        "passages": [
            "Many ants can cooperatively transport large food items (either coordinated or uncoordinated during transportation), which can be rarely observed in other animals besides humans.",
            "Our studies showed that S. invicta used multiple strategies to transport food items on vertical surfaces (tree trunks).",
            "Competition and deadlocks were frequently observed during individual and collective transport respectively."

    "experimental manipulation": {
        "reasoning": "Experimental manipulation involves changing variables to observe effects, which is indicated by the investigation of various factors like food placement, shape, and particle sizes on transport behaviors.",
        "passages": [
            "We investigated the effects of food placement (placed on a platform or fixed on tree trunk), food shape (cuboid or flattened), particle sizes (0.45-1, 1-2, 2-3, or 3-4 mm), and placement height (20, 80, or 150 cm) on the food transport on tree trunks."
