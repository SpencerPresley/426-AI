    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of deregulating foreign equity ownership on a firm's innovation investment. The study finds that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between foreign ownership and R&D investment, where initial foreign ownership increases R&D investment due to better managerial oversight, but this effect diminishes as foreign ownership becomes more concentrated. Additionally, the study examines firm heterogeneity, noting that older firms negatively moderate this relationship, while firms with growth opportunities positively moderate it.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research, which is to explore how deregulating foreign equity ownership affects a firm's investment in innovation. The study's key findings include an inverted U-shaped relationship between foreign ownership and R&D investment, and the moderating effects of firm age and growth opportunities. These points are central to understanding the research's contributions without delving into the specific methodologies used.",
