    "summary": "The research investigates how team members' actual expertise and social status influence their perceived expertise and overall influence within team processes. It examines the conditions under which teams rely on perceived expertise versus social status to determine influence relationships. The study also explores how the importance of expertise and social status varies based on the type of intragroup conflicts and the stages of team projects. The findings indicate that social status drives perceived expertise in the early stages of team projects, while actual expertise becomes more influential in later stages. Additionally, perceived experts are more influential when task conflict is high or relationship conflict is low.",
