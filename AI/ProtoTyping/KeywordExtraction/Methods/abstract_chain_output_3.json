    "detailed_summary": "The study explores the combination of alliances and acquisitions by firms within an exploration/exploitation framework. Using cluster analysis on a sample of 1270 acquisitions by 836 firms, the researchers identified five distinct patterns of alliance and acquisition activities: low alliance-low acquisition, low alliance-high acquisition, high alliance-low acquisition, high alliance-high acquisition, and medium alliance-very high acquisition. The study then analyzed how these patterns interlinked the two modes in terms of exploration and exploitation strategies. Patterns III and IV were found to involve both exploration and exploitation, with these strategies mutually reinforcing each other. In contrast, the remaining patterns showed a looser coupling between alliances and acquisitions, with a focus on exploitation."
