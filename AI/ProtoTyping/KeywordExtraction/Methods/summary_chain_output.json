    "summary": "The research investigates the impact of deregulating foreign equity ownership on innovation investment in Korean manufacturing firms. The study finds that foreign ownership and R&D investment have an inverted U-shaped relationship, where initial foreign ownership boosts innovation investment due to increased managerial oversight, but this effect diminishes as foreign ownership becomes more concentrated. Additionally, the study examines firm-specific factors, revealing that older firms are negatively affected by foreign ownership, while firms with growth opportunities benefit positively.",
