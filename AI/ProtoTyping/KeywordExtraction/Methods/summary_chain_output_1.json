    "summary": "This research investigates the impact of deregulating foreign equity ownership on a firm's innovation investment. The study finds that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between foreign ownership and R&D investment. Initially, foreign ownership increases R&D investment due to better managerial oversight, but this effect diminishes as foreign ownership becomes more concentrated. Additionally, the study examines firm heterogeneity, noting that older firms tend to invest less in R&D, while firms with more growth opportunities invest more.",
    "reasoning": "The abstract clearly outlines the main objective of the research, which is to explore how deregulating foreign equity ownership affects a firm's innovation investment. The findings highlight an inverted U-shaped relationship between foreign ownership and R&D investment, providing insights into the dynamics of managerial oversight and its diminishing returns. Furthermore, the study considers firm-specific factors such as age and growth opportunities, which influence R&D investment. This comprehensive approach captures the essence of the research without delving into the specific methodologies used.",
