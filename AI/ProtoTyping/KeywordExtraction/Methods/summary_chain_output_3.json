    "summary": "This research investigates how firms integrate alliances and acquisitions within the context of exploration and exploitation strategies. The study identifies five distinct patterns of alliance and acquisition activities among firms and examines how these patterns interlink the two modes of operation. The findings reveal that some patterns involve both exploration and exploitation strategies that mutually reinforce each other, while other patterns show a looser connection with a focus on exploitation.",
    "reasoning": "The abstract focuses on understanding the combination of alliances and acquisitions by firms within an exploration/exploitation framework. It identifies distinct patterns in these activities and analyzes how these patterns interlink the two modes of operation. The key findings highlight the varying degrees of integration and focus on exploration and exploitation strategies across different patterns.",
