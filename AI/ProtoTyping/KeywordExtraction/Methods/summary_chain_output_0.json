    "summary": "The research investigates how team members' actual expertise and social status influence their perceived expertise and, consequently, their influence within the team. It examines the conditions under which teams rely more on perceived expertise versus social status to determine influence relationships, particularly in relation to different types of intragroup conflicts. The study finds that social status drives perceived expertise at the early stages of team projects, while actual expertise becomes more influential at later stages. Additionally, perceived experts are more influential when task conflict is high or when relationship conflict is low.",
    "reasoning": "The summary captures the main idea of the research, which is to understand the dynamics of influence within teams based on actual expertise and social status. It highlights the key findings that social status initially drives perceived expertise, but actual expertise becomes more important over time. The summary also notes the conditions under which perceived experts are more influential, providing a comprehensive overview of the research without delving into specific methodologies.",
