    "summary": "The research investigates how managers' perceptions of employees' organizational commitment influence their evaluations of the employees' career growth opportunities. The study finds that managers use employees' attitudes and behaviors, such as extra-role performance and work engagement, to gauge their emotional commitment to the organization. Employees perceived as highly committed to the organization are given better career growth opportunities. Additionally, the relationship between managers' perceptions of organizational commitment and career growth opportunities is stronger for employees who are also seen as highly committed to their own careers.",
