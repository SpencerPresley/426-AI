    "    You are a method extraction AI whose purpose is to identify and extract method keywords from an academic abstract. Your role is to locate the specific methodologies, techniques, or approaches mentioned in the abstract and provide justification for why each keyword represents a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### Definition of Methods:\n",
    "    - \"Methods\" refers to the **specific processes**, **techniques**, **procedures**, or **approaches** used in conducting the research. This includes techniques for data collection, data analysis, algorithms, experimental procedures, or any other specific methodology employed by the researchers. Methods should not include general descriptions, conclusions, or research themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### What You Should Do:\n",
    "    1. Extract keywords that refer to the **methods** used in the abstract.\n",
    "    2. For each keyword, provide a **reasoning** explaining why it represents a method in the context of the abstract.\n",
    "    3. Present the results in the required **JSON format** with a list of methods and justifications for each.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### JSON Output Requirements:\n",
    "    - **Response Format**: You must return your output as a JSON object.\n",
    "    - The JSON object must contain:\n",
    "    - A key `\"methods\"` whose value is a list of extracted **method keywords**.\n",
    "    - A key for each method keyword that containes 2 keys:\n",
    "        - `\"reasoning\"`: A string that provides the **reasoning** behind why that keyword was extracted.\n",
    "        - \"passages\": A list of strings that are the passages from the abstract that lead you to believe that this is a method keyword.\n",
    "        - \"confidence_score\": A float between 0 and 1 that represents the confidence in the keyword.\n",
    "        \n",

    "    “Drawing on expectation states theory and expertise utilization literature, we examine the effects of team members’ actual expertise and social status on the degree of influence they exert over team processes via perceived expertise. We also explore the conditions under which teams rely on perceived expertise versus social status in determining influence relationships in teams. To do so, we present a contingency model in which the salience of expertise and social status depends on the types of intragroup conflicts. Using multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams with 320 members at a large national research institute located in South Korea, we found that both actual expertise and social status had direct and indirect effects on member influence through perceived expertise. Furthermore, perceived expertise at the early stage of team projects is driven by social status, whereas perceived expertise at the later stage of a team project is mainly driven by actual expertise. Finally, we found that members who are being perceived as experts are more influential when task conflict is high or when relationship conflict is low.

    "    Drawing on expectation states theory and expertise utilization literature, we examine the effects of team members' actual expertise and social status on the degree of influence they exert over team processes via perceived expertise. We also explore the conditions under which teams rely on perceived expertise versus social status in determining influence relationships in teams. To do so, we present a contingency model in which the salience of expertise and social status depends on the types of intragroup conflicts. Using multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams with 320 members at a large national research institute located in South Korea, we found that both actual expertise and social status had direct and indirect effects on member influence through perceived expertise. Furthermore, perceived expertise at the early stage of team projects is driven by social status, whereas perceived expertise at the later stage of a team project is mainly driven by actual expertise. Finally, we found that members who are being perceived as experts are more influential when task conflict is high or when relationship conflict is low. We discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice.\n",

    "    The goal of this paper is to investigate how deregulating foreign equity ownership influences a firm's innovation investment. We attempt to answer this question using data from 530 Korean manufacturing firms between 1998 and 2003 through generalised estimating equations. Our findings suggest that foreign ownership and R&D investment exhibit an inverted U-shaped relationship because the incentives to monitor managers' decision-making processes initially play a greater role, but this role stagnates as the share owned by foreign investors becomes concentrated. In addition, we consider firm heterogeneity and observe the negative moderation effects of firm age and the positive moderation effects of growth opportunity.\n",

    "    This study examined the role of perceived organizational commitment on managers' assessments of employees' career growth opportunities. Based on a paired sample of 161 legal secretaries and their managers, results indicated that managers used the attitudes and behaviors displayed by employees (strong extra-role performance and enhanced work engagement) as cues from which to base their perceptions of employees' affective commitment to the organization. In turn, employees perceived as highly committed to the organization experienced enhanced content and structural career growth opportunities. Moreover, the relation between managers' perceptions of employees' organizational commitment and content career growth opportunities was stronger for employees perceived as also highly committed to their careers than for employees perceived as less committed to their careers.\n",

    "    This study examined how firms combine alliances and acquisitions in an exploration/exploitation framework. By conducting cluster analysis on a sample of 1270 acquisitions made by 836 firms, we first identified the patterns in alliance and acquisition activities undertaken by these firms. Five distinct patterns were identified: (I) low alliance-low acquisition, (II) low alliance-high acquisition, (III) high alliance-low acquisition, (IV) high alliance-high acquisition, and (V) medium alliance-very high acquisition. Next, we analyzed the different ways in which the two modes were interlinked within these five patterns for exploration/exploitation. Patterns III and IV appeared to involve both exploration/exploitation and mutually reinforce exploration/exploitation. In contrast, in the remaining patterns, the two modes appeared to be more loosely coupled with each other, with a focus on exploitation.\n",
