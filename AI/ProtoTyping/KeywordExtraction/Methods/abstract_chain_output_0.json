    "detailed_summary": "The study draws on expectation states theory and expertise utilization literature to investigate the effects of team members' actual expertise and social status on their influence over team processes through perceived expertise. It explores the conditions under which teams rely on perceived expertise versus social status to determine influence relationships. A contingency model is presented, suggesting that the importance of expertise and social status varies based on the type of intragroup conflicts. Using multiwave survey data from 50 student project teams in South Korea, the study finds that both actual expertise and social status have direct and indirect effects on member influence through perceived expertise. It also reveals that social status drives perceived expertise at the early stages of team projects, while actual expertise becomes more influential at later stages. Additionally, perceived experts are more influential when task conflict is high or relationship conflict is low. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for both research and practical applications."
