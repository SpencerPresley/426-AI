        "summary": "The research investigates how team members' actual expertise and social status influence their perceived expertise and, consequently, their impact on team processes. It explores the conditions under which teams prioritize perceived expertise over social status in determining influence relationships. The study introduces a model that links the importance of expertise and social status to different types of intragroup conflicts. Findings from survey data of student teams in South Korea reveal that both actual expertise and social status affect influence through perceived expertise. Early in team projects, social status drives perceived expertise, while actual expertise becomes more influential later. Additionally, perceived experts are more influential when task conflict is high or relationship conflict is low. The study concludes with a discussion on the implications of these findings for both research and practical applications.",
        "reasoning": "The summary captures the main ideas of the research by focusing on the investigation of the effects of actual expertise and social status on perceived expertise and team influence. It also highlights the conditions under which these factors are prioritized and the introduction of a model linking expertise and social status to intragroup conflicts. The findings and their implications are also summarized, providing a comprehensive overview of the research without delving into the specific methodologies used.",
        "feedback": "The previous assistant's analysis was thorough and accurate, providing clear meanings and reasonings for each sentence. This made it straightforward to extract the main ideas and themes of the abstract. No significant issues were encountered. However, it would be helpful if the previous assistant could also provide a brief summary of the abstract in their analysis to cross-verify the final summary."
